<H3>University Course in Parallel Computing 
</H3>
<P>I team-taught CS 442 at the University of New Mexico in the fall of
1997 with Bruce Hendrickson. The theme of the course was parallel
scientific computing, with a strong distributed-memory bias. The
lecture topics were mostly algorithm discussions; programming
assignments were parallel codes written with <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/index.html">MPI</A>.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "class/cs442.html">class outline</A> which includes several interesting
homework and programming assignments. We used Peter Pacheko's
"Parallel Programming with MPI" as a background textbook and added a
lot of our own material.
