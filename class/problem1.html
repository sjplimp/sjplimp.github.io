<b> Due:</b> Tuesday, September 30th

(1) You are tired of having your programs write output to the screen
in random jumbled order.  Write a few lines of pseudocode that are
executed by all processors, produce this style of output, and that
require no more than <b>2P</b> sends/receives, where <b>P</b> is the number of
processors.  It should work for any value of <b>P</b>.
<BR>
<P>
	Proc 0: value is 4
<BR>
	Proc 1: value is 2
<BR>
	Proc 2: value is 7
<BR>
	Proc 3: value is 15
<BR>
	...
<BR>
<P>
If you were writing to a file instead of the screen, typically only
processor 0 would open the file and do the ``writes''.  Write a
section of pseudocode that satisfies this new constraint.  How many
sends/receives are now required?
<BR>

(2) Consider a finite difference calculation performed on an NxN grid, similar
to the parallel game-of-life simulations we have
been discussing.  Assume that updating the value for each grid cell
requires 8 floating-point operations (same 9-point stencil as the
GOL), and communication is needed at the start of each timestep to
update ghost-cell values.  Analyze the two parallelization strategies
discussed in class for programming assignment 3: (1) a
one-dimensional decomposition of the grid over <b>P</b> processors, and
(2) a two-dimensional decomposition across Q*Q=P processors.  For
each strategy, write down a formula for the total CPU time per
timestep in terms of communication startup (alpha), inverse
bandwidth per byte (beta) and time per flop (tau), as well as
<b>N</b> and <b>P</b> (or <b>Q</b>).  You can assume that <b>N</b> is an exact multiple of <b>P</b>, and
that each communicated ghost-cell value requires eight bytes of
memory.  For each strategy, derive formulas for the parallel speedup
and efficiency as a function of the same parameters.
For the 2-d strategy, assuming the startup cost is negligible, how
quickly must <b>N</b> grow as a function of <b>P</b> to keep the parallel
efficiency constant?
<BR>
<P>
On Sandia's Intel Tflops machine, the following values are
approximately correct (in nanoseconds): alpha = 20000, 
beta = 3, and tau = 10.  For each of
the two strategies running on 1024 processors, how large must <b>N</b> be
to keep the cost of communication below 20% of the total run time?
<BR>
<P>

(3) Consider the recursive halving and recursive doubling operations
described in class.  For <b>P</b> a power-of-two, write some pseudocode
using these operations to perform a broadcast of a <b>N</b>-length vector
with 2*log(P) message startups and only <b>2N</b> total communication
volume.  Note: Although it requires more startups, for large <b>N</b> this
is <em> better</em> than the N*log(P) communication volume required by the
tree-structured (cascade) broadcast you programmed for the first
assignment.
