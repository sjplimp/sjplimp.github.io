CS442 Assignment 1<BR> 
Embarrassingly Parallel Game-of-Life
</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<b> Due:</b> Tuesday, September 9th
<P>
<b> Goals:</b>
<P>
<OL><LI> Get up and running on the parallel machine(s).  You'll have to
      figure out how to log in, edit, compile, run and debug parallel
      programs.
<P>
<LI> Use simple MPI calls; implement two collective communication
      routines yourself.
<P>
<LI> Investigate scaling performance of your code.
<P>
<LI> Develop code you'll use as starting point for later assignments.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<b> Background:</b>
<P>
Pretend, if you're not already, that you are a biologist interested in
studying the ecology of the Gila Wilderness.  Because you can't get
cable TV within the Gila, instead of doing field work you decide to
perform computational simulations.  You know that water is a scarce
resource, and that competition for the limited precipitation is
fierce.  In particular, if a plant is crowded by too many neighbors,
it will die of thirst.  However, due to the symbiotic relationship
between the different types of vegetation, a plant with no neighbors
will die as well.  Plants will only survive if they manage to find the
right ecological niche.  Your plan is to investigate possible
ecological scenarios and to determine which ones generate stable
populations.
<P>
<b> Assignment:</b>
<P>
We'll give you a sequential code that runs the <em> game-of-life</em>.
The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of size NX by NY.
Each grid point has a value from 0 to 10, which represents the current
density of vegetation at a given point.  Initially, all values are
randomly set to 0 or 1, with probability = PROB that a particular
point has value 1.  This process is based on a user-input random
number SEED.
<P>
A timestep of the game consists of updating the value of every grid
point according to the following rules:
<P>
<OL><LI> SUM = sum of current values at the 8 neighboring points (left/right,
up/down, 4 corner points).  The grid is treated as a torus; that is,
think of the bottom of the grid as touching the top, and the right as
touching the left.
<P>
<LI> If SUM <b>&lt;=</b> 3 or SUM <b>&gt;=</b> 25, then decrement value by 1 (too lonely or
crowded).
<P>
<LI> If SUM <b>&gt;=</b> 4 and SUM <b>&lt;=</b> 15, then increment value by 1 (growth condition).
<P>
<LI> If SUM <b>&gt;</b> 15 and SUM <b>&lt;</b> 25, no change in value (just right).
<P>
</OL>
<P>
A single game runs for many timesteps until it terminates under one of
3 conditions:
<P>
<OL><LI> All the vegetation dies.
<P>
<LI> It reaches steady-state, where the total vegetation (sum of all
values on the grid) doesn't change for 10 timesteps.  Often, instead
of settling down to a single configuration the solution will cycle
with periodicity 2 or 3.  Such cycling is considered to be a
steady-state solution and likewise terminates after 10 steps.
<P>
<LI> It exceeds 200 timesteps without reaching steady-state.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
A complete simulation using the serial code runs N independent games,
one after the other and prints out some statistics: the fraction of
games that died out, the fraction that reached steady-state, and the
fraction that exceeded the time limit.  For the steady-state games,
the code also computes the average time to stabilization and the average
amount of vegetation alive on the grid.
<P>
Your assignment is to make this code parallel in the obvious way by
having each of the P processors run N/P of the independent games.
With the same inputs, your code should give identical answers when run
on any number of processors.  But life is simple in the Gila and in
this first assignment -- you can assume P is a power-of-two
(1,2,4,8,etc) and that N is a multiple of P.
<P>
Communicating the simulation parameters will require a <em>
broadcast</em> operation and computing the statistics will require a <em>
reduce</em> operation.  You can use MPI calls to get this working quickly,
but in the final version of your code, you must write these operations
yourself, using MPI-Send and MPI-Receive.
<P>
<b> What you hand in:</b>
<P>
<OL><LI> A program listing of your code.  Since poorly formatted codes
      are difficult to grade, we expect you to include comments and to
      make your program easy to read.  In what you hand in, you can
      omit the subroutines from the serial code that you don't change,
      but you should include the main program and any additional
      subroutines you write, particularly your broadcast and reduction
      routines.
<P>
<LI> The statistical results from 2 runs, 
      each on various numbers of processors, including P = 1.
<P>
      (1) NX = NY = 50, PROB = 0.35, N = 128, SEED = 314159
<P>
      (2) NX = NY = 100, PROB = 0.28, N = 256, SEED = 271828
<P>
      We are looking to see that you get the correct answers and that
      your answers do not depend on P.
<P>
<LI> A simple log-log plot of CPU time vs. P for one (or both) of
      these problems.  Include a line that shows what ``perfect''
      speed-up would be, along with data points for your actual
      timings.  Tell us why you think the program scaled as it did.
<P>
<LI> Brief (!) answers to the Open Questions below.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<b> Sequential Version:</b>
<P>
You should start with sequential code to solve this problem which can
be downloaded here in either <A HREF="Program1.c">C</A> or
<A HREF="Program1.f">Fortran</A>.
<P>
<b> Open Questions:</b>
<P>
<OL><LI> Some of the games finish much faster than others,
      leaving their processors idle.  Can you think of any way to
      improve the parallel performance of the code?
<P>
<LI> If done correctly, you should get the same answers to these
      problems, no matter how many processors you run on.  Can you
      think of reasons this might be difficult or impossible to
      achieve in other kinds of simulations?
<P>
<LI> Does your code crash or give different answers if P is not a
      power-of-two?  Or if N is not a multiple of P?  Or if N <b>&gt;</b> P?
      If so, why, and what would you have to change to make your code
      more robust?  (Note: You don't have to actually make these
      changes.)
<P>
<LI> (Optional) What can be done to get cable TV introduced to the Gila and
      would it enhance vegetation growth ?
