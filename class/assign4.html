<b> Background:</b>
<P>
While watching Melrose Place, it suddenly dawns on you that you've
been ignoring the impact of wild animals in your Gila vegetation
simulations.  The largest herbivores in the Gila are elk, so you
decide to simulate their movements.  The Gila elk have evolved a
strategy that maximizes their chance of survival by balancing two
opposing forces: they must be dispersed enough to not compete for
food, but be close enough to attract potential mates.  Not unlike
their Melrose counterparts, the elk achieve this balance via one of
nature's great spectacles --- elaborate bugling rituals.  Once a day
each elk bugles to announce his/her location and listens for the
return calls from other elk.  Each elk then moves so as to be far
enough from the others to have sufficient vegetation, but close enough
to be within bugling range for the next day.  Voluminous research has
revealed that this can be modeled by having elk i move as if it feels
a (vector) force due to elk j that is the derivative of a simple
formula for their repulsive/attractive energy of interaction: (see
class handout for mathematical representation).  Unfortunately,
whenever an elk leaves the Gila and wanders onto neighboring private
land, it is immediately shot by eager Lincoln County ranchers.
<BR>
<P>
<b> Assignment:</b>
<P>
You will write a parallel program to simulate the 2-d movements of the
Gila elk.  Serial <A href="Program4.c">C</A> and <A
href="Program4.f">Fortran</A> codes which perform this task are
available; use them as a starting point.  The input parameters are the
number of elk (N), the size of the circular wilderness region
(RADIUS), the number of timesteps (NSTEPS), and a random number seed
(SEED).  Essentially, the code computes the force interactions between
all N^2 pairs of elk every timestep and integrates Newton's
equations of motion forward in time.  The specifications for the
initial randomized positions/velocities of the elk, the force
calculation, the time integrator, and the rancher-enforced boundary
conditions are more easily described in the code than in words.  The
output of a simulation is the number of remaining elk, their average
speed, and the position of a particular elk.
<P>
Your parallel code should implement the force-decomposition particle
algorithm described in class using the MPI collective communication
routines AllGather and Reduce_Scatter.  It is not necessary to
implement Newton's 3rd law.  Running on P processors, the code should
accept PX and PY (PX*PY=P) as input and give the same answers for any
PX by PY decomposition of the force matrix, including PX=1, PY=P or
PX=PY=sqrt(P) or PX=P, PY=1.  Your code should give the same
answers running on any P including P = non-power-of-2 and P=1.
<P>
At the end of a run, your code should print-out NALIVE = the number of
elk remaining inside the RADIUS, the average speed of the NALIVE elk,
and the x,y coordinates of elk NOUTPUT.  It should also print-out the
total CPU time (of just the timestep loop) and the time spent in
communication.  The difference is presumably computation time.
<BR>
<P>
<b> What you hand in:</b>
<P>
<OL><LI> A program listing of your code, commented in the
      sections where you made additions or changes.
<P>
<LI> Output for 2 problems, each run on various numbers
      of processors, including (if your machine supports it) some runs
      on non-power-of-two P.  Also, for problem (1) show some output
      for runs with the same P, but where you vary PX and PY,
      including the cases where PX=1 and where PY=1.
<P>
      (1) Fixed-size problem:
<P>
        N = 120, RADIUS = 50.0, NTIMES = 50, SEED = 123456, NOUTPUT = 50
<P>
      (2) Scaled-size problem:
<P>
        N = 30*P, RADIUS = 50.0, NTIMES = 50, SEED = 654321, NOUTPUT = 25
<P>
      As before, we are looking to see that you get the correct
      answers and that (for problem 1) your results do not depend on P
      or on PX or PY.
<P>
<LI> A simple table of timings for the 2 problems for different P and
      PX,PY values that lists the total run-time, computation time,
      communication time, and overall speed-up and parallel
      efficiency.
<P>
<LI> A simple log-log plot of total CPU time vs. P for both of these
      problems.  Include curves that show what ``perfect'' speed-up
      would be, along with data points for your actual timings.  Also,
      for problem (1), a plot of total and communication time vs. PX
      where PX ranges from 1 to P.  Tell us why you think the plots
      show what they do.
<P>
<LI> Brief (!) answers to the Open Questions below.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
<b> Optional:</b>
<P>
The serial codes include a "dump" function that writes snapshots of
the elk coordinates to a "dump.out" file.  This file may be visualized
with a program called "xmovie" that resides in /home/u/sjplimp/bin on
the Sandia network and in /home/sjplimp on laguna at the ARC.  Note:
these are Sun SPARC executables.  With the usual X-window permissions
in place, typing "(path)/xmovie -2d dump.out" will pop up an animated
X window of the elk movement.  When doing timing runs with your
parallel code, you should comment out the calls to "dump" or simply
delete the function.  However, you are welcome to parallelize the
"dump" routine if you wish to experiment with parallel I/O and
visualize the results of your parallel runs.
<P>
<b> Open Questions:</b>
<P>

<OL><LI> If you simulated millions of elk for thousands of timesteps
      would you expect to get exactly the same answers running on any
      P?  Why or why not?
<P>
<LI> Consider two runs where PX = 1, PY = P and PX = P, PY = 1.  Do
      you expect the communication cost of the two runs to be the
      same?  Why or why not?
<P>
<LI> How might you modify the code to exploit Newton's 3rd law and
      cut the cost of computation in half?  Would this incur any extra
      communication?
<P>
<LI> Is your code's performance affected by the initial density
      distribution of elk?  I.e. if some regions of the wilderness
      have very high density, will your code run slower?
<P>
<LI> (Optional) If Melrose Place were filmed in the Gila,
      speculate on the response of Lincoln County ranchers.
