<H3>General Overviews of Parallel Computing 
</H3>
<P>These are papers I wrote or contributed to that discuss a
Sandia-centric view of the state of parallel computing.  I freely
admit to a strong distributed-memory message-passing bias.  That is,
I've never thought the following concepts were that useful in
practice: shared-memory machines, SIMD programming methodologies, or
automatic parallelizing compilers.
</P>
<P>Of course when you work at Sandia with a series of big
distributed-memory machines and everyone lives and breathes message
passing, you tend to look at the world as one big nail to pound your
favorite hammer on!
