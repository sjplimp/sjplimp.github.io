University Course in Parallel Computing :h3

I team-taught CS 442 at the University of New Mexico in the fall of
1997 with Bruce Hendrickson. The theme of the course was parallel
scientific computing, with a strong distributed-memory bias. The
lecture topics were mostly algorithm discussions; programming
assignments were parallel codes written with "MPI"_mpi.

This is the "class outline"_outline which includes several interesting
homework and programming assignments. We used Peter Pacheko's
"Parallel Programming with MPI" as a background textbook and added a
lot of our own material.
