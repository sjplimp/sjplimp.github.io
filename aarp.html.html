<H3>Basics 
</H3>
<HR>

<HR>

<p></p>

<H4><A NAME = "ssnm"></A>* SS card and NM license or ID 
</H4>
<PRE>Required to have SS cards for all people listed on tax form:
  self, spouse (if filing jointly), dependents
  only exception is if have a SSA-1099 with the SS # on it
  CANNOT just use last years form, could be fraud 
</PRE>
<PRE>Required to have NM license or ID for state form
  maybe just if requesting refund?
  CANNOT be expired 
</PRE>
<PRE>if client says they filed thru AARP before
  but their SS does not show up in system
  then either I entered SS# incorrectly
  of they did not choose last year for AARP to retain their info 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "interview"></A>* Interview 
</H4>
<PRE>Ask on various forms of income
  make a slash mark on form if not relevant
  SSI = supplemental security income of disability benefits
    no form, but should have a letter
    these benefits are not federal taxable, but need to be entered on state 
</PRE>
<PRE>Ask on various deductions or credits
  particularly ones relevant for state
    prop tax or rent
    child care
    medical over 28K or assisted living fraction
    armed forces retirement
    public school teacher supplies 
</PRE>
<PRE>Ask on IRS Identity Protection number (IP PIN) - 6 digits
  efile will fail if exists but not entered 
</PRE>
<PRE>Initial pre-check of tax forms and intake forms
  use a highlighter pen to mark important parts of forms
  make notes on paper about fed/state tax withheld
    to ensure they are accounted for in final PDF for tax returns
  make notes for anything else to remember at end
  make Notes on intake form about Qs to address by me or reviewer
    anything to help reviewer 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "scope"></A>* Scope 
</H4>
<PRE>Cannot do military returns - not certified
1099-DA = digital asset, could be on brokerage statement
  applies to selling DA, not receiving, I think
  receiving is out of scope 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "pin"></A>* IRS PINs 
</H4>
<PRE>ask EVERYONE about this, since it is becoming more common 
</PRE>
<PRE>if they have an IRS PIN, make sure to enter it in Basic Info section
  else federal submission will bounce
  emphasize to them, they need to get a new PIN each year from on-line account 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "qss"></A>* Filing as a QSS = qualified surviving spouse 
</H4>
<PRE>  can be done for a couple years after a spouse passes away
  but REQUIRES there be a dependent child (possibly other kinds of dependents)
  TaxSlayer has a Filing Status Wizard option to help with this 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "depend"></A>* Dependents 
</H4>
<PRE>if have income of more than $5K, may have to do something 
</PRE>
<PRE>child in prison does not qualify as dependent
  b/c govt is providing majority of cost for their care 
</PRE>
<PRE>difference between a dependent child and a qualifying dependent
  don't really understand this - Laura explained but it is complicated 
</PRE>
<PRE>what if a dependent child has substantial income, e.g. more than $5050/year
  does not disqualify as a dependent so long as parent providing > half-support
  Q: can child be filing their own tax return, e.g. to get taxes refunded?
    not sure, but I don't think they can claim self as a dependent
  calculation for half support
    S = sum of parents income P and child's income C
        for child this would include a job or SS survivor benefits, etc
        but not SSI support for child, at least for federal tax purposes
    H = half of S = support needed for the child (2 people in house)
    if C < half of H, then parent is providing > half-support for child
  example 1: P = 50K, C = 10K, H = 30K
    parent is providing 20K for child's support which is more than half of 30K
  example 2: P = 50K, C = 20K, H = 35K
    parent is providing 15K for child's support which is less than half of 35K 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "efile"></A>* Efiling choices 
</H4>
<PRE>When efile: need to choose federal/state mode of filing and payment
ALWAYS choose EFILE option, unless tax payer needs to add a death certificate
  for a reecently deceased spouse - then choose paper file,
  and reviewer will print 2 copies of forms: one for client to mail, other to keep
If client received refund, can choose bank account or check mailed to them
If client owes tax (including zero), can choose bank debit or mail them a check
If owes $$, can choose future date for bank debit, or can physically mail
  check (with a voucher form we give them) anytime before deadline 
</PRE>
<PRE>in TY 2025, federal refunds must be by direct deposit
  some exceptions are allowed
  think AARP can file without, but taxpayer will get a letter 
</PRE>
<PRE>maling in a return by taxpayer
  if no tax owed, mail to Austin
  if check included, mail to Louisville 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "older"></A>* Older year taxes 
</H4>
<PRE>  do them before this year, so that this-year forms will auto-populate
  next year I should be able to do 2025 and 2024, but not earlier
  do this by selecting TY 2024 in PRO menu 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "estimate"></A>* Estimated payments 
</H4>
<PRE>client needs to have records of having made these payments (e.g. checks)
  enter these payments for tax year: both federal and state on federal form
  future payments (for next year): enter federal on federal form
    enter state on state form
    this will print vouchers for client to use in coming year 
</PRE>
<PRE>estimated taxes
  if paid this year, print them vouchers for next year
  likewise if way underpaid this year, offer vouchers for next year
  last year payment for fed/state are both under federal
  next year vouchers are under fed and state 
</PRE>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "print"></A>* Printing 
</H4>
<PRE>  I can print directly for a one-page form like "Itemized Deductions"
  or the output of the Colorado form for future year usage 
</PRE>
<HR>

</PRE>
<PRE>enhanced deduction for seniors
  $6000 for seniors 65+

  MAGI income limits for phasing out:
    for single,HoH - 75K to 175K
    married filing jointly - 150K to 250K
    married filing separately - not available
  MAGI = certain deductions and tax-exempt income added back 
</PRE>
<PRE>no tax on tips rules
  must be voluntary, not mandatory tips
    e.g. if restaraunt adds 20% for parties of 6+, then not a tip
  use Schedule 1-A to calculate/claim
  tip income must be listed on a form, e.g. W-2 
</PRE>
<PRE>no tax on overtime rules
  can deduct the portion of income that is OT pay
  not for salaried employees

</PRE>
<PRE>car loan - can deduct interest
  only for new car and for personal use (not business car)
  only for an individual
  not for a leased car
  must be original loan, not refinance
  car must have final assembly in US
    VIN will specify this, think it means it just start with a number 
</PRE>
<PRE>SS fairness payments:
  may have received extra SS payments in 2025 b/c includes back pay
  term: WEP or GPO or for other reasons
  option #1 - include all SSA payments in 2025 income
  option #2 - assign back pay to 2024 income
    use taxable portion of it to add to 2025 income
    to do this will need 2024 tax return
    the SS computation can be printed out by TaxSlaer
  TaxSlayer can do it both ways, use whatever is less tax 
</PRE>
<PRE>NOTE: if a surviging spouse is getting no SS b/c income is too high,
  tell them to re-apply b/c law has changed 
</PRE>
<H4><A NAME = "nmchange"></A>* Changes NM in TY 2025

<HR>

<H3>Income 
</H3>
<HR>

<HR>

<p></p>

<H4><A NAME = "zero"></A>* Zero income except SS 
</H4>
<P>If federal income is zero (only SS), then add fictitious Income of one dollar
  to trigger filing of federal tax forms, this allows state filing as well
  do this as Interest Income from Bank of Efile, not Other
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "w2"></A>* W2 forms 
</H4>
<P>box 14 is a special case, ask for help if see it
</P>
<P>PERA line for insurance deduction on a W2
  counts as medical deduction
  does NOT count as lowered income
</P>
<P>OVT or other overtime indication
  info needs to be entered as a deduction
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "int"></A>* 1099-INT form 
</H4>
<P>1099-INT with multiple entries from a single institution
  can enter each under one entry, and have TaxSlayer do the summation
</P>
<P>if have 2 forms from same institueion (e.g. Interest or 1099-B)
  enter 2 different names for institution
  e.g. append last few digits of account #
  this is to make it easier for reviewer to decipher
</P>
<P>1099 forms with tax-free interest (or dividends?)
  in a special box on form
  refers to federal tax, but are NOT tax-free for state
  so need to enter the same amount again in TaxSlayer beneath the first box
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "savebond"></A>* Interest and savings bonds, federal vs state issue 
</H4>
<P>Savings bond interest
  taxable on federal, NOT taxable on state
  enter amount on 1099-INT in Savings Bond box
    right below it, indicate not taxable in state
  this will trigger state PIT-ADJ entry in box 9
  if instead it is entered on state form as a deduction,
    will trigger PIT-ADJ entry in box 7 (same effect, but wrong box)
  same idea for T-Bill gains like in my WROS investment account
    taxable on federal, NOT taxable on state
</P>
<P>Converse for federal vs state
  some bond interest/div is NOT taxable on federal, but is on state
</P>
<P>2 places to enter federal int/div which are not taxable for NM
  this is besides the savings bond interest
  (1) on state form, can enter NM tax-exempt int/div as a deduction
  (2) on fed 1099-DIV form (and poassibly INT) can enter a value near the end
      for apply no state tax and choose NM
  not sure of the difference between them, but show up as
    different lines on PIT-ADJ form
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "oid"></A>* 1099-OID form 
</H4>
<P>1099-OID - there is a TaxSlayer form for this under Int/Div section
  I think idea is that if investment (bonds) were bought at a speical dicount,
    then taxes are owed on that discount each year during term of bonds
  check 2 things to verity that tax form is IN SCOPE
  FATCA filing required box must NOT be checked
  no non-zero amount in box 6 for Acquisition Premiiums
  one i have seen only had box 1 amount so was in scope
  for tax purposes OID amount is treateted like taxable interest
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "retire"></A>* 1099-R form 
</H4>
<P>if 1099-R is from OMP = office of manangement personnel
  then may not have SS form, even if 65+, b/c OMP payments include it 
  they also include client's Medicare payments
  don't fully understand this, but saw an example in 2026
</P>
<P>For annuities
when do I need to use Colordado Simple form
</P>
<P>(a) if IRA/SEP/SIMPLE box is not checked (for an IRA distribution)
  then the distribution is from an annuity
</P>
<P>(b) if box 2a Taxable Amount is empty or box 2b for not computed is
  checked, it means the payer did not compute taxable amount
</P>
<P>then need to use Simplified Method to compute it
  goto Colorado tools calculator, first entry on that webpage
  important to know month/year of the "annuity start date"
    this is the later of 2 dates:
      date of first day of period for which a payment was received
      date on which annuity obligations became fixed
  other amounts to enter are from tax form
  if start date is long ago, there may no longer be a tax-free portion
    i.e. full amount is taxable
  otherwise it will give an amount to enter as Taxable Amount
</P>
<P>if health insurance line appears on 1099-R
  can be OUTSIDE all the boxes
  if can be a deductible medical expense (on fed form, carried to state)
  example is PERA, but not always labeled that way
  verify it is health insurance, not life insurance
  I think idea is that the gross distribution includes the health ins
    but the taxpayer never receives those $$
  similar to SS gross minus Medicare payments (not received by taxpayer)
  maybe health insurance deduction on a W-2 works the same way
    but TaxSlayer knows how to interprent codes on W-2
    so it uses it as medical expense automatically (like Medicare)
</P>
<P>what if a 1099-R pension distribution is taxable in another state
  e.g. if a state tax withdrawal was paid to another state
  ask the client, and look for a state ID that doesn't start with NM
  there is a way to handle this, but don't know the details
    Robert told me he could show me how to do this
  the key idea is that the client wants to have
    the state income (from the distribution) to only be taxed once
    but it will carry over from federal to NM when we use TaxSlayer
  what we cannot do is file a state return for another state,
    e.g. to get a refund for the state tax withdrawn by another state
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "rmdqcd"></A>* RMD from IRA with qualified charitable donation = QCD 
</H4>
<P>  should have paperwork on QCD
  idea: reduces income declaration of RMD
  there is a place in TaxSlayer to enter this as QCD near the 1099-R forms
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "brokerage"></A>* 1099-B brokerage form 
</H4>
<P>if have capital gains/loss, need to find short-term/long-term info to enter
  note that 1099-Div forms can have captital gain entries as well - that is different
</P>
<P>brokerage statements for 1099-B
  one of two places under Income in TaxSlayer
  simple form when only proceeds/cost
  more complex form when additional adjustments (wash, etc)
</P>
<P>carry-over capital losses
  ask about this for last year if they have brokerage statements with cap gain/loss
  otherwise Taxslayer will not know, even if did taxes with us previously
  if have big losses this year, carrying over to next year
    tell them to be aware of this
    put note on outer envelope so we will hopefully see it next year
    print worksheet with this year's taxes which shows cap loss to carry over next year
</P>
<P>1099-B if one form has both "reported to" and "not reported to"
  basis for sold investements, then need to enter it as two
  1099-B entries in TS, b/c I think they are treated differently
  on schedule D and accompanying form 8949
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "foreign"></A>* Foreign tax over $300 
</H4>
<P>  will only get a federal tax credit of $300 max unless file form 4111
  TS allows this (if search for it), but is out-of-scope for AARP
    unless preparer is internationally certified
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "k-1"></A>* 1099 K-1 form for a real estate investment trust 
</H4>
<P>  TS has 1000-K forms, for self-employment I think, but they
  seem different than K-1 - filling it in for Springer form
  did not work the way it did for Mary Lois - several things were
  unclear
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "hsa"></A>* 1099-SA form for HSA distributions 
</H4>
<P>  search for form in TaxSlayer, should be under deductions ?
  ask if the distributions were spent for medical
    this is the rule, if not then the distribution is taxable
  both the distribution and amount of medical expenenses are boxes in TaxSlayer
  ask if they made self-contributions to their HSA this year
    this is also entered on the form
  company contributions do not count
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "529edu"></A>* 1099-Q form for 529 education savings accounts 
</H4>
<P>  529s are savings accounts to use for children/grandchildren's education costs
  run by a state, not federal govt
  contributions are deductible from state income in the year they were made
  withdrawals are not taxable if used for qualified educations purposes
    this is pretty broad, look on-line for what qualifies
  a withdrawal is partly the original contribution (basis)
    and part gain (by the 529 investement)
  if withdrawal is NOT spent in same calendar year, then it is
    a taxable distribution
  for federal, tax effect has 2 parts
    declare the gain as income
    pay a 10% penalty on the gain
      are some exceptions to the penalty, TaxSlayer explains them
    this is out-of-scope for AARP, but can be easily done in TaxSlayer
    creates a 5329 form, enters 2 numbers on Schedule 1 and 2
  for state, any previously deducted state income must be
    declared as income in withdrawal year
    this is only for the basis portion
      simplest case is that all the basis was previously deducted
      if partial, not sure how to do it, probably as a percentage
      see NM instructions
    the gain portion will carry-over from the federal return
</P>

<H3>Deductions and Credits 
</H3>
<HR>

<HR>

<p></p>

<H4><A NAME = "educator"></A>** Educator expenses 
</H4>
<P>can be entered for both federal and state
$300 max for state
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "medical"></A>** Medical expenses 
</H4>
<P>new in 2026, no state medical deductions
  so don't bother to enter them as federal itemized deductions
    unless itemize on federal (rare)
  only relevant state deduction is for 65+ with out-of-pocket over $28K
    there is no income limit on this
</P>
<P>percentage received as state deduction depends on income
</P>
<P>can include all out-or-pocket medical or dental or therapy expenses
  nursing home or assisted living fraction
  Medicare payments
  health insurance premiums, could be on 1099-R in a box or separate labeled line
  so make sure they are all included
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "property"></A>** Property tax deduction 
</H4>
<P>Prop tax - have to itemize on federal
Prop tax - 2 versions on state
  (1) 16K MGI limit for everyone
  (2) 24K MGI limit for Bern and other counties
  MGI adds SS and other non-taxable federal income
  have to enter these, does not pull from federal itemized
  not sure if refundable or not
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "rent"></A>** Rent deduction 
</H4>
<P>Rent - similar to prop tax
  enter it on same page for (11) 16K limit prop tax
  enter total rent paid for entire year (client + govt), also indicate if govt assisted
</P>
<P>is on State property tax deduction form
  Enter total rent, even if client only paid part and govt subsidized rent.
  Enter rent for the year, not monthly rent.
</P>
<P>On state form can get credit for rent paid is income is sufficiently low
  enter as property tax under state Deduction section
  enter total amount of yearly rent (including any portion govt paid)
  and check box if had govt rent assistance (e.g. HUD)
  apartments should know amount of total rent
</P>
<P>Should lookup state eligiblity for prop tax and for rent
  when does it make a difference ?
</P>
<P>rent credit on state taxes
  only number needed is total rent (self + govt)
  number is for YEAR, not per month
  is it only useful to do if received govt assistance, e.g. HUD
  what is income limit ?
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "std-vs-item"></A>** Standard vs itemized deduction 
</H4>
<P>if fill-in itemmized there is a Compare button to see Std vs Item
  also a good way to see what Standard is for their filing category
  categories for Itemized:
    mortgage interest, property tax, state refund, charitable donations
    medical expenses over 7.5% of income - think only portion over
      7.5% is considered a deduction
    only medical expenses auto-fills on state form
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "state-refund"></A>** NM tax refund in previous year 
</H4>
<P>may be taxable on federal, and deducted from NM
  but ONLY if itemized deductions in previous year
  should get 1099-G tax form from state (probably not, if did not itemize)
  TaxSlayer will not know if itemized last year
  should be extra income on 1040 line 8 and Schedule A line 1
  there is a federal worksheet for how much to enter on Sched A, line 1
    may have to do this by hand
    idea: if reduction last year did not dip below standard deduction
      threshold, then all of it is taxable this year
      if partially dipped below, then is pro-rated
  should also enter on NM forms, shows up on PIT-ADJ line 21 as deduction
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "energy"></A>** Energy credit 
</H4>
<P>on federal is only for windows, furnaces, AC, insulation, possibly water heaters
need a receipt that shows itemized amount (not including other work)
  and verification from company that the material qualifies (hi quality)
</P>
<P>Purchase of wood burning stove can get energy credit b/c if is a biomass stove
  is this federal or state credit ? - federal I believe
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "ssi-snap"></A>** SSI and SNAP benefits 
</H4>
<P>need to enter extra govt assistance on state forms
</P>
<P>If disabled person or dependent gets SSI, won't have SSA-1099 statement
  but should have letter about amount of assistance received
