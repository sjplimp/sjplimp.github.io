<H3>PRONTO - transient dynamics with contact detection 
</H3>
<P>PRONTO is a Sandia transient-dynamics finite-element code that is
similar in scope to DYNA-3D or Pam-Crash. It models objects undergoing
deformation; prototypical examples are a car crash or the
denting/crushing of a shipping container. PRONTO includes a wide
variety of material models and a smoothed- particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) capability that enables high-strain simulations (e.g. an
explosion) that would typically tangle or break conventional finite
element meshes.
</P>
<P>Here is a cool example of how accurately such codes model reality. The
left figures are high-speed photographs of a bullet passing through a
metal plate. A PRONTO simulation of the same effect is on the
right. Note that the simulation nicely captures the bending and
roll-over of the bullet trajectory.
</P>

</CENTER>
<P>The finite element portion of these calculations can be
straightforwardly parallelized. A harder challenge is the so-called
"contact detection" problem.  When a car bumper impacts the radiator
or the bullet touches the plate surface there are additional push-back
forces that come into play which must first be detected as mesh
overlap. This figure illustrates the kinds of mesh inter- penetration
and particle/mesh overlap that must be searched for at every timestep.
</P>

</CENTER>
<P>Contact detection has proven difficult to parallelize effectively
because it involves a global search across all processors (any 2
processor's elements can overlap) and it dynamically changes as the
simulation progresses (elements initially far apart can later
overlap). Also it only involves the surface of the 3-d finite element
mesh, whereas the mesh is decomposed volumetrically to
processors. Hence the search operation can be severely load-imbalanced
and require large volumes of communicated data. Consider this
idealized container crush simulation where the can folds up in an
intricate fashion. When the can is fully crushed, portions of the can
surface are touching that initially (in the uncrushed can) were far
apart in the mesh topology.

<P>Or consider this simulation of a bar hitting a stack of bricks. As the
bricks fly apart, any two bricks (owned by any two or more processors)
may come in contact.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "images/pronto_bricks.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>Previous parallelization efforts for the contact detection problem
generally used a single decomposition of the mesh for both the finite
element analysis and the contact detection. They suffered from the
load-balance problems described above and typically did not scale to
more than a few dozen procesors.  In our approach, we use two
different decompositions for the two computational steps. We use the
standard static, graph-based decomposition for the finite element
calculation, and a dynamic, geometric decomposition for the contact
detection. Each timestep processors send surface element data (new
coordinates) to other processors which own those elements in the
geometric decomposition.  The surface elements are re-balanced via
recursive coordinate bisectioning (RCB) which assigns each processor a
compact domain of elements and nodal points. Each processor can then
search its local domain (with a bit of overlap with its neighbors) for
contacts. The results are shipped back to the processors that own the
elements in the finite-element decomposition.
</P>
<P>The result is that the two most expensive portions of a PRONTO
timestep (finite-elemnt analysis and contact detection) now
load-balance independently.  There is an overhead cost to ship data
back and forth between the two decompositions but it turns out to be
small in practice. The resulting code runs scalably on 1000s of
processors which has enabled Sandia analysts to run extremely large
calculations - tens of millions of elements for long timescales. The
code has been optimized for the Intel Tflops machine where it runs at
over 100 Gflops on 3000 dual-processor Pentium nodes. This earned the
PRONTO work a finalist status for the 1997 Gordon Bell Prize (see
paper below) and the gold cup at the <A HREF = "http://parallel.rz.uni-mannheim.de/sc/suparcup99">1999 SuParCup competition</A>
in Mannheim, Germany.

<P>Here is a result from a calculation of foam struts (a packing
material) being compressed between two plates. It involves a
considerable amount of contact detection and push-back between the
individual struts to model the material response correctly (colors
represent the stress state of the material).
</P>

</CENTER>
<P>Adding smoothed particle hydrodyanmics (SPH particles) to PRONTO's
finite element computations can also pose load-imbalance
problems. This is because the particles may only fill a fraction of
the simulation domain and they have the same dynamic characteristics
as the contact-detection problem. We added a 3rd decomposition to
PRONTO to handle SPH particles, so that particle-particle interactions
are load-balanced separately, again using the geometric RCB techinque
mentioned above.
</P>
<P>Here are two examples of coupled finite-element/SPH calculations. In
the 1st figure, particles are used to model the earth as a penetrator
passes thru.  Using a high-resolution finite-element grid for the
penetrator, these kinds of simulations can predict the response of
small components in the penetrator to a high-velocity impact.

<P>The following papers describe our parallel contact and parallel SPH
algorithms in detail and give an overview of the kinds of simulations
PRONTO can perform.  They also provide performance results for a few
large-scale simulations running on 1000s of processors of the Intel
Tflops machine.
