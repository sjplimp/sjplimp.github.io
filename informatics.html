<H3>Informatics Algorithms and Big-Data Processing 
</H3>
<P>Informatics is the term commonly used for calculations that are more
data-intensive than compute-intensive.  Often such calculations are
limited by the size of the data sets that can be handled rather than
the total amount of raw computation they require.  Algorithms for data
mining, classificiation, machine learning, and pattern matching can
fall in this category.
</P>
<P>Informatics is now being performed on Terabyte and even Petabyte data
sets on large distributed <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</A> platforms via
programming paradigms such as <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapreduce">MapReduce</A>, implemented in
software packages like <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop">Hadoop</A>.  With my background in
large-scale parallel computing, I'm interested in seeing whether
traditional supercomputers can also be used effectively for these
kinds of tasks.
</P>
<P>To experiement with this, we've written two different software
packages.
</P>
<P>The first implements MapReduce on top of distributed-memory message
passing (<A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI</A>).  Our open-source software is called the
<A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov">MapReduce-MPI (MR-MPI) library</A>, and can
be downloaded <A HREF = "download.html">here</A>.  The <A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html">doc pages for the
library</A> describe the
software in more detail.

<P>The second is a small open-source library that serves as a framework
for running streaming calculations in a pipelined fashion, as a set of
independent processes passing a continuous stream of data among
themselves.  The library is called <A HREF = "phish.html">PHISH</A>, for Parallel
Harness for Informatic Stream Hashing, because fish swim in a stream.
The <A HREF = "phish/doc/Manual.html">doc pages for the library</A> describe the
software in more detail.

algorithms.
