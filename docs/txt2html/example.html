<A NAME = "lists"></A><B>Lists:</B> 

<P>This is a bulleted list, created with a single :ul appended to the
last line of the list:
</P>
<UL><LI>item 1
<LI>item 2
<LI>item 3 
</UL>
<P>This is a numbered list; an :ol command is appended:
</P>
<OL><LI>item 1
<LI>item 2
<LI>item 3 
</OL>
<P>And this is a definition list, using a :dl command:
</P>
<DL><DT>item 1
<DD>  This is a description of the first item.
<DT>item 2
<DD>The text file doesn't need any indentation so long as each of the 6 entries in the list is a single line in the example.txt file; the list format creates the indentation.  This entry in the example.txt file illustrates the use of the "\" character at the end of lines, to create one long line.
<DT>item 3
<DD>  This is a description of the third. 
</DL>
<P>An item in a list can have multiple lines and paragraphs if the
formatting commands are applied to each line of the list:
</P>
<UL><LI>item 1 

<LI>item 2 

<P>This is a 2nd paragraph associated with item 2. 
</P>
<P>This is a 3rd paragraph. It can be as long as needed to describe the item.  It
will keep going until a :p formatting command is placed
at the end of a line. 
</P>
<LI>item 3 
</UL>
<HR>

<P><B>Commands applied to each line in the paragraph:</B>
</P>
<CENTER>This entire paragraph is centered</CENTER>
<CENTER>line by line</CENTER>
<CENTER>by appending :all(c) to the</CENTER>
<CENTER>last line. </CENTER>
