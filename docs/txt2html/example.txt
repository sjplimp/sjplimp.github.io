Example txt2html Document :c,h3

This document illustrates simple examples of all the formatting and
mark-up that the "txt2html"_README.html tool recognizes.  This
example.html file was created from the text file example.txt by
typing:

txt2html example.txt > example.html

:line

[Mark-up Syntax:]

This is an example of [bold text].  This is an example of {italicized
text}.  This text is [{both bold and italicized}].

This is a "link"_#lists to another location in this document.

This is a "link"_README.html to another document, the README.html in
this same directory.

This is a "link"_alias1 to another location in the README.html document.

This is a "link"_alias2 to the Google WWW site.

If you look in example.txt you will see that the first 2 links were
created in-line, while the last 2 used an alias to a definition
elsewhere in the example.txt file.

:link(alias1,README.html#markup)
:link(alias2,http://www.google.com)

:line

[Paragraph Styles:]

This is a default paragraph with no formatting styles appended.

This paragraph has a :p command appended.  It should look the same as
the default. :p

This paragraph has a :b command appended.  It should have no following
newline. :b

This paragraph has a :c command appended.  It should be centered. :c

This paragraph has a :h3 command appended. :h3

This paragraph has a :c,h3 command appended.  It will also be centered :c,h3

This paragraph has a :pre appended.
It will appear with a different font and
  with spacing exactly as in the example.txt file. :pre

:line

[Lists:] :link(lists)

This is a bulleted list, created with a single :ul appended to the
last line of the list:

item 1
item 2
item 3 :ul

This is a numbered list; an :ol command is appended:

item 1
item 2
item 3 :ol

And this is a definition list, using a :dl command:

item 1
  This is a description of the first item.
item 2
The text file doesn't need any \
indentation so long as each of the 6 entries in the list is a \
single line in the example.txt file; the list format creates the \
indentation.  This entry in the example.txt file illustrates the \
use of the "\" character at the end of lines, to create one long line.
item 3
  This is a description of the third. :dl

An item in a list can have multiple lines and paragraphs if the
formatting commands are applied to each line of the list:

item 1 :ulb,l
item 2 :l
This is a 2nd paragraph associated with item 2. :p
This is a 3rd paragraph. It can be as long as needed to describe the item.  It
will keep going until a :p formatting command is placed
at the end of a line. :p
item 3 :l,ule

:line

[Commands applied to each line in the paragraph:]

This entire paragraph is centered
line by line
by appending :all(c) to the
last line. :all(c)

This entire paragraph consists of short lines
that are left-justified.
This is done by appending :all(b) to the
last line. :all(b)

This is a simple bulleted list with no indentation, by appending
:all(l) to the last line.

item 1
item 2
item 3 :all(l)

:line

[Special commands:]

This leading and trailing horizontal breaks for this section were
created using the :line command.

The :c,image(file) command inserts this image of an equation.  The "c"
causes it to be centered.

:c,image(equation.gif)

The :image(file,link) command inserts it again, and allows you to click
on it to go to the Google WWW site.

:image(equation.gif,http://www.google.com)

The :link(name) and :link(alias,value) commands were illustrated earlier
in this document.

:line

[Table command:]

This is a simple default table created by appending :tb to the last
line.

Procs, 1, 2, 4
CPU, 10.0, 5.1, 2.8 :tb

The next table used :tb(b=5,s=;,a=r) to create a larger border, use a
different delimiter character in the example.txt file, and align to
the right of the browser window.

Procs; 1; 2; 4
CPU; 10.0; 5.1; 2.8 :tb(b=5,s=;,a=r)

The next table with :tb(w=100%,ea=c) has a width percentage that fills
100% of the screen and the text in each entry aligned to the center.

Procs, 1, 2, 4
CPU, 10.0, 5.1, 2.8 :tb(w=100%,ea=c)

The next table with :tb(cw1=5x0%,w=20,ca1=r) has the width of column 1
= 50%, the rest of the columns of width 20 pixels, and the data in
column 1 aligned to the right.

Procs, 1, 2, 4
CPU, 10.0, 5.1, 2.8 :tb(cw1=5x0%,w=20,ca1=r)

The next table with :tb(c=3,cva1=t,eva=bo,cw2=60) has three columns.
Column one is vertically aligned to the top, there is a break row
specified by just commas, the data is vertically aligned to the
bottom, and the width of column 2 is 60 pixels.

Section One,
Line One 
Line Two 
Line Three,
Column three,
, , ,
[Section Two (bold)], Line One Line Two Line Three, Co
lumn 3   
:tb(c=3,cva1=t,eva=bo,cw2=60)

The next table with :tb(c=3,cva1=t,b=0,w=60%,cw3=80%,s=***) has three
columns (only two that have information - see heading two).  Column
one is vertically aligned to the top, there is no border, the width of
column 3 is 80% of the table, the width of the table is 60% of the
screen, and the separator is not a comma (it is ***).

[Heading One]*** ***
A couple of sentences that wrap.  For example, a definition, 
an explanation, a point about this particular page, and so 
forth.  The lines wrap, no matter where you insert newlines, if 
you specify a specific number of columns.  Don't forget to include 
spaces, or your words will also wrap together.*** 
*** *** ***
[Heading Two]*** ***
There is a bit of a break between the last paragraph and heading two
because we inserted a row of blank space.  There is a separator column
between the heading and the paragraphs because we included an extra
separator there (compare with distance between columns in table
above).  To make the distance larger, put &lt;br&gt; in the extra
cell.  It need not be included in every row, just one.
:tb(c=3,cva1=t,b=0,w=60%,cw3=80%,s=***)

The next table with :tb(c=3,b=0,w=60%,cw2=5%,s=***) has columns equals
three, there is no border, the width of the entire table covers 60% of
the screen, column two has a width of 5% of the table, and the
separator is, again, ***.

[Heading One]*** *** [Heading Two]***
This table is similar to the last one. A couple of sentences that
wrap.  For example, a definition, an explaination, a point about this
particular page, and so forth.  The lines wrap, no matter where you
insert newlines, if you specify a specific number of columns.  Don't
forget to include spaces, or your words will also wrap together.***
*** This table has no extra row like the one above, but it does have
the extra column to separate the data columns.  This column is 5% of
the total width, so it is big enough to make a clear break between the
columns, but not overwhelming. More text to wrap.  More text to wrap.
More text to wrap.  More text to wrap.  More text to wrap. More text
to wrap.
:tb(c=3,b=0,w=60%,cw2=5%,s=***)
