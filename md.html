<H3>Molecular Dynamics - Parallel Algorithms 
</H3>
<P>I work in the area of classical molecular dynamics (MD).  It's an
atomistic simulation method where:
</P>
<UL><LI>each atom is treated as a point mass,
<LI>simple force rules describe the interactions between atoms
<LI>Newton's equations are integrated to advance the atomic positions &   velocities, and
<LI>thermodynamic statistics are extracted from the motion of the atoms. 
</UL>
<P>I've worked on several parallel algorithms that are useful for MD
simulations.  They are described in the next section.
</P>
<P>I've also written several parallel MD codes that I distribute freely.
They are available from <A HREF = "download.html">this page</A>.
</P>


<P>Performance of these parallel codes for a variety of systems (atomic,
polymer, biomolecular, metal, granular) on several parallel platforms
are discussed on the <A HREF = "https://www.lammps.org/bench.html">Benchmark
page</A> of the <A HREF = "https://www.lammps.org">LAMMPS
website</A>.
</P>
<P>Simulation efforts that I've been involved in are discussed on <A HREF = "mdsim.html">this
page</A>.  Work of others using these codes is listed on the
<A HREF = "https://www.lammps.org/bench.html">Publications page</A> of the <A HREF = "lammmps">LAMMPS

<P>This paper describes 3 classes of parallel algorithms suitable for
short-range MD force fields: so-called atom-, force-, and
spatial-decomposition algorithms.  All 3 are implemented and compared
in the paper, but the only one I "invented" was force-decomposition
which was work with Bruce Hendrickson at Sandia.
</P>
<P>In a nutshell, atom-decomposition methods assign a subset of atoms
permanently to each processor, force-decomposition methods assign a
subset of pairwise force computations to each proc, and
spatial-decomposition methods assign a sub-region of the simulation
box to each proc.
