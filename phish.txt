which is software for writing parallel programs that process streaming
data. :b

This is the home page for the PHISH library, which is the chief
component of a simple framework for processing large volumes of data,
either in a real-time streaming context or from files.

PHISH stands for Parallel Harness for Informatic Stream Hashing.  The
phishy metaphor is meant to evoke the image of many small minnows
(programs) swimming in a stream (of data).

PHISH is a lightweight framework which a set of independent processes
can use to exchange data as they run on the same desktop machine, on
processors of a parallel machine, or on different machines across a
network.  This enables them to work in a coordinated parallel fashion
to perform computations on either streaming or archived data.

The PHISH distribution includes a simple, portable library for
performing data exchanges in useful patterns either via "MPI
message-passing"_mpi or "ZMQ sockets"_zmq.  PHISH input scripts are
used to describe a data-processing algorithm, and an additional tool
provided in the PHISH distribution converts the script into a form
that can be launched as a parallel job.

PHISH was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US Department
of Energy facility, for use on "informatics problems"_informatics.  It
has a C-style interface which can be used from any hi-level language,
including C, C++, Fortran, or Python.  PHISH is distributed as an
open-source code, under the terms of the modified "Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) License"_bsd.  See "this
page"_phish/open_source.html for more details.

The authors of PHISH are "Steve Plimpton"_sjp and Tim Shead, who can
be contacted at sjplimp at sandia.gov and tshead at sandia.gov.

The PHISH WWW site is hosted by Sandia, which has this "Privacy and
