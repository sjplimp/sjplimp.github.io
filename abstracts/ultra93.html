<P>Monte Carlo electron trajectory simulations have been adapted to run
on a parallel supercomputer. The increased speed achieved by
parallelization of the Monte Carlo code results in the ability to
model small probability events easily. The techniques for
parallelization of the algorithm are presented here along with
examples of applications. The applications include the calculation of
the X-ray spatial resolution in thin films, backscattered electron
imaging of voids in Al metallizations and X-ray production in
thin-film specimens.
