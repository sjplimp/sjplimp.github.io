<P>Particle-in-cell simulations often suffer from load-imbalance on
parallel machines due to the competing requirements of the field-solve
and particle-push computations. We propose a new algorithm that
balances the two computations independently. The grid for the
field-solve computation is statically partitioned. The particles
within a processor's sub-domain(s) are dynamically balanced by
migrating spatially-compact groups of particles from heavily loaded
processors to lightly loaded ones as needed. The algorithm has been
implemented in the QUICKSILVER electromagnetic particle-in-cell
code. We provide details of the implementation and present performance
results for QUICKSILVER running models with up to a billion grid cells
and particles on thousands of processors of a large distributed-memory
parallel machine.
