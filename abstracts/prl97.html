<P>We present the results of a molecular dynamics computer simulation
study in which we investigate whether a supercooled Lennard-Jones
liquid exhibits dynamical heterogeneities. We evaluate the
non-Gaussian parameter for the self part of the van Hove correlation
function and use it to identify "mobile" particles. We find that these
particles form clusters whose sizes grow with decreasing
temperature. We also find that the relaxation time of the mobile
particles is significantly shorter than that of the average particle,
and that this difference increases with decreasing temperature.
