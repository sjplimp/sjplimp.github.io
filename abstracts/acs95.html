<P>S. J. Plimpton and B. A. Hendrickson, chapter in Parallel Computing in
Computational Chemistry, edited by T. G. Mattson, published by the
American Chemical Society, Symposium Series 592, 114-132 (1995).
</P>
<P>Three classes of parallel algorithms for short--range classical
molecular dynamics are presented and contrasted and their suitability
for simulation of molecular systems is discussed. Performance of the
algorithms on the Intel Paragon and Cray T3D in benchmark simulations
of Lennard--Jones systems and of a macromolecular system is also
highlighted.
