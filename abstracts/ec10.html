<P>Multiscale simulation is a promising approach for addressing a variety
of real-world engineering problems. Various mathematical approaches
have been proposed to link single-scale models of physics into
multiscale models. In order to be effective, new multiscale simulation
algorithms must be implemented which use partial results provided by
single-scale software. This work considers aspects of software design
for interfacing to existing single-scale simulation code to perform
multiscale simulations on a parallel machine. As a practical example,
we extended the large-scale atomistic/molecular massively parallel
simulator (LAMMPS) atomistic simulation software to facilitate its
efficient use as a component of parallel multiscale-simulation
software. This required new library interface functions to LAMMPS that
side-stepped its dependence on files for input and output and provided
efficient access to LAMMPS's internal state. As a result, we were able
to take advantage of LAMMPS's single-scale performance without adding
any multiscale-specific code to LAMMPS itself. We illustrate the use
of LAMMPS as a component in three different modes: as a stand-alone
application called by a multiscale code, as a parallel library invoked
by a serial multiscale code, and as a parallel library invoked by a
parallel multiscale code. We conclude that it is possible to
efficiently re-use existing single-scale simulation software as a
component in multiscale-simulation software.
