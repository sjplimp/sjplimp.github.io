The surface micromachining processes used to manufacture MEMS devices
and integrated circuits transpire at such small length scales and are
sufficiently complex that a theoretical analysis of them is
particularly inviting. Under development at Sandia National
Laboratories (SNL) is Chemically Induced Surface Evolution with Level
Sets (ChISELS), a level-set based feature-scale modeler of such
processes. The theoretical models used, a description of the software
and some example results are presented here. The focus to date has
been of low-pressure and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, LPCVD and PECVD)
processes. Both are employed in SNLs SUMMiT V technology. Examples of
step coverage Of SiO2 into a trench by each of the LPCVD and PECVD
process are presented.
