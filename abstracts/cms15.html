<P>Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is a coarse-grained particle-based
simulation method that offers microscopic-scale insights into soft
matter systems. We present an efficient implementation of a DPD model
for graphical processing units (GPUs). As implemented in the LAMMPS
molecular dynamics package, it can run effectively on
current-generation supercomputers which often have hybrid nodes
containing multi-core CPUs and (one or more) GPUs. Using efficient
communication of information between the CPUs and GPUs, DPD
interactions can be computed on the GPU while other portions of a full
simulation model (boundary conditions, constraints, bonded
interactions, diagnostic calculations, etc.)  can be performed on the
CPU. Our GPU-enhanced runs show a speedup of up to 9.5 versus
many-core CPU simulations, and can run scalably across thousands of
compute nodes. We briefly discuss how the new GPU implementation was
validated against the CPU version for thermodynamics, diffusion, and
hydrodynamic behavior. We also highlight large-scale models which the
faster DPD implementation has enabled, for studies of monolayer
self-assembly and thin-film instabilities.
