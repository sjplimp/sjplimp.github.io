<P>Short--range molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems are
commonly parallelized by replicated--data methods, where each
processor stores a copy of all atom positions. This enables
computation of bonded 2--, 3--, and 4--body forces within the
molecular topology to be partitioned among processors
straightforwardly. A drawback to such methods is that the
inter--processor communication scales as N, the number of atoms,
independent of P, the number of processors. Thus, their parallel
efficiency falls off rapidly when large numbers of processors are
used. In this article a new parallel method for simulating
macromolecular or small--molecule systems is presented, called
force--decomposition. Its memory and communication costs scale as
N/sqrt(P), allowing larger problems to be run faster on greater
numbers of processors.  Like replicated--data techniques, and in
contrast to spatial--decomposition approaches, the new method can be
simply load--balanced and performs well even for irregular simulation
geometries. The implementation of the algorithm in a prototypical
macromolecular simulation code ParBond is also discussed. On a
1024--processor Intel Paragon, ParBond runs a standard benchmark
simulation of solvated myoglobin with a parallel efficiency of 61% and
at 40 times the speed of a vectorized version of CHARMM running on a
single Cray Y--MP processor.
