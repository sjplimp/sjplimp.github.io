<P>Simulating energetic materials with complex microstructure is a grand
challenge, where until recently, an inherent gap in computational
capabilities had existed in modelling grain-scale effects at the
microscale. We have enabled a critical capability in modelling the
multiscale nature of the energy release and propagation mechanisms in
advanced energetic materials by implementing, in the widely used
LAMMPS molecular dynamics (MD) package, several novel coarse-graining
techniques that also treat chemical reactivity. Our innovative
algorithmic developments rooted within the dissipative particle
dynamics framework, along with performance optimisations and
application of acceleration technologies, have enabled extensions in
both the length and time scales far beyond those ever realised by
atomistic reactive MD simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate these
advances by modelling a shockwave propagating through a
microstructured material and comparing performance with the
state-of-the-art in atomistic reactive MD techniques. As a result of
this work, unparalleled explorations in energetic materials research
are now possible.
