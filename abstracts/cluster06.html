<P>The RandomAccess benchmark as defined by the High Performance
Computing Challenge (HPCC) tests the speed at which a machine can
update the elements of a table spread across global system memory, as
measured in billions (giga) of updates per second (GUPS).  The
parallel implementation provided by HPCC typically performs poorly on
distributed-memory machines, due to updates requiring numerous small
point-to-point messages between processors.  We present an alternative
algorithm which treats the collection of P processors as a hypercube,
aggregating data so that larger messages are sent, and routing
individual datums through dimensions of the hypercube to their
destination processor.  The algorithm's computation (the GUP count)
scales linearly with P while its communication overhead scales as
log_2(P), thus enabling better performance on large numbers of
processors.  The new algorithm achieves a GUPS rate of 19.98 on 8192
processors of Sandia's Red Storm machine, compared to 1.02 for the
HPCC-provided algorithm on 10350 processors.  We also illustrate how
GUPS performance varies with the benchmark's specification of its
``look-ahead'' parameter.  As expected, parallel performance degrades
for small look-ahead values, and improves dramatically for large
values.
