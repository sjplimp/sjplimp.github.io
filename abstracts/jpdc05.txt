The traditional, serial, algorithm for finding the strongly connected
components in a graph is based on depth first search and has
complexity which is linear in the size of the graph.  Depth first
search is difficult to parallelize, which creates a need for a
different parallel algorithm for this problem.  We describe the
implementation of a recently proposed parallel algorithm that finds
strongly connected components in distributed graphs, and discuss how
it is used in a radiation transport solver.
