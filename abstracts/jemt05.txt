Molecular dynamics calculations are performed to study the effect of
deformation sequence and history on the inelastic behavior of copper
interfaces on the nanoscale. An asymmetric 45 deg tilt bicrystal
interface is examined, representing an idealized high-angle grain
boundary interface. The interface model is subjected to three
different deformation paths: tension then shear shear then tension,
and combined proportional tension and shear Analysis shows that
path-history dependent material behavior is confined within a finite
layer of deformation around the bicrystal interface. The relationships
between length scale and,interface properties, such as the thickness
of the path-history dependent layer and the interface strength, are
discussed in detail.
