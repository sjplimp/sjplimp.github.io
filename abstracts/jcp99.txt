The diffuse behavior of penetrants in simple polymer melts was
investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. For the case where the
polymer melt consisted of pearl-necklace chains, the diffusive
behavior of the loose pearl penetrants was seen to be qualitatively
different than would be expected in realistic models of polymer
melts. In particular, there was little or no "non-Fickian" region; the
variation of the diffusion coefficient with the penetrant diameter was
what one would expect for diffusion through small molecular liquids;
and, finally, the long time tail of the velocity autocorrelation
displayed a -3/2 power law form, also as in the small molecular liquid
case. When the chains' backbone motion was further constrained by the
introduction of a bond angle potential, the qualitative nature of the
penetrant diffusion became more "polymer-like." A non-Fickian region
developed; the diffusion coefficient varied more rapidly with
penetrant diameter; and the velocity autocorrelation function
developed a -5/2 power law tail.
