The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is investigated using the
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of molecular gas
dynamics. Due to the inherent statistical noise and the significant
computational requirements, DSMC is hardly ever applied to
hydrodynamic flows. Here, DSMC RMI simulations are performed to
quantify the shock-driven growth of a single-mode perturbation on the
interface between two atmospheric-pressure monatomic gases prior to
re-shocking as a function of the Atwood and Mach numbers. The DSMC
results qualitatively reproduce all features of the RMI and are in
reasonable quantitative agreement with existing theoretical and
empirical models. Consistent with previous work in this field, the
DSMC simulations indicate that RMI growth follows a universal
behavior.
