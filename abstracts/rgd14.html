<P>In the 50 years since its invention, the acceptance and applicability
of the DSMC method have increased significantly. Extensive
verification and validation efforts have led to its greater
acceptance, whereas the increase in computer speed has been the main
factor behind its greater applicability. As the performance of a
single processor reaches its limit, massively parallel computing is
expected to play an even stronger role in its future development.
