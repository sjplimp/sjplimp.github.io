<P>A method for accelerating kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of solid
surface morphology evolution, based on the equation-free projective
integration (EFPI) technique, is developed and investigated. This
method is demonstrated through application to the 1+1 dimensional
solid-on-solid model for surface evolution. EFPI exploits the
multiscale nature of a physics problem, using fine-scale simulations
at short times to evolve coarse length scales over long times. The
method requires identification of a set of coarse variables that
parameterize the system, and it is found that the most obvious coarse
variables for this problem, those related to the ensemble-averaged
surface position, are inadequate for capturing the dynamics of the
system. This is remedied by including among the coarse variables a
statistical description of the fine scales in the problem, which in
this case can be captured by a two-point correlation
function. Projective integration allows speedup of the simulations,
but if speed-up of more than a factor of around 3 is attempted the
solution can become oscillatory or unstable. This is shown to be
caused by the presence of both fast and slow components of the
two-point correlation function, leading to the equivalent of a stiff
system of equations that is hard to integrate. By fixing the fast
components of the solution over each projection step, we are able to
achieve speedups of a factor of 20 without oscillations, while
maintaining accuracy.
