The kinetic Monte Carlo method and its variants are powerful tools for
modeling materials at the mesoscale, meaning at length and time scales
in between the atomic and continuum.  We have completed a 3 year LDRD
project with the goal of developing a parallel kinetic Monte Carlo
capability and applying it to materials modeling problems of interest
to Sandia.  In this report we give an overview of the methods and
algorithms developed, and describe our new open-source code called
SPPARKS, for Stochastic Parallel PARticle Kinetic Simulator.  We also
highlight the development of several Monte Carlo models in SPPARKS for
specific materials modeling applications, including grain growth,
bubble formation, diffusion in nanoporous materials, defect formation
in erbium hydrides, and surface growth and evolution.
