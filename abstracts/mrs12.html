<P>We discuss the relative complexity and computational cost of several
popular many-body empirical potentials, developed by the materials
science community over the past 30 years.  The inclusion of more
detailed many-body effects has come at a CPU cost, but the cost still
scales linearly in the number of atoms modeled.  This is enabling very
large molecular dynamics simulations with unprecedented atomic-scale
fidelity to physical and chemical phenomena.  The serial and parallel
performance of the potentials are benchmarked in the LAMMPS molecular
dynamics code.  Several recent large calculations performed with these
potentials are highlighted, to illustrate what is now possible on
current supercomputers.  We conclude with a brief mention of
high-performance computing architecture trends and the research issues
they raise for continued potential development and use.
