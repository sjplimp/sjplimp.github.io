[Particle-Mesh Ewald and rRESPA for Parallel Molecular Dynamics
Simulations]

S. J. Plimpton, R. Pollock, M. Stevens, in Proc of the Eighth SIAM
Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing,
Minneapolis, MN, March 1997.

The parallel implementation of a molecular dynamics code suitable for
simulation of general molecular systems using spatial--decomposition
methods is discussed. Long-range Coulombic forces are computed using a
particle-mesh Ewald (PPPM) technique. A multiple--timescale
integration method known as rRESPA is also used to improve the
computational efficiency. The load--balancing and interprocessor
communication issues that arise from implementing PPPM and rRESPA
within a spatial--decomposition framework are highlighted. Some
performance numbers for large--scale biomembrane simulations on a
Intel Paragon are given.
