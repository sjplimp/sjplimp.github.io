Massively parallel computers promise unique power for engineering and
scientific simulations. Development of parallel software tools and
algorithms that take full advantage of this power is a continuing
challenge to computational researchers. In this paper we discuss the
advantages a message-- passing multiple--instruction/multiple--data
(MIMD) programming approach has for parallel simulations and two
domain--decomposition and load--balancing methods designed to optimize
data locality and minimize communication costs on large parallel
machines. The methods have proven useful for parallel computations in
a broad range of technical fields including structural and fluid
dynamics and chemical, biological, and materials science.
