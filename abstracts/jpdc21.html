<P>Rendezvous algorithms encode a communication pattern that is useful
when processors sending data do not know who the receiving processors
should be, or vice versa. The idea is to define an intermediate
decomposition where datums from different sending processors can
"rendezvous" to perform a computation, in a manner that both the
senders and eventual receivers of the results can identify the
appropriate rendezvous processor.
</P>
<P>Originally designed for interpolating between overlaid grids with
independent parallel decompositions (Plimpton et al., 2004), we have
recently found rendezvous algorithms useful for a variety of
operations in particle- or grid-based simulation codes when running
large problems on large numbers of processors. In particular, we show
they can perform well when a load-balanced intermediate decomposition
is randomized and not spatial, requiring all-to-all communication to
move data between processors. In this case rendezvous algorithms
leverage the large bisection communication bandwidths which parallel
machines provide.
</P>
<P>We describe how rendezvous algorithms work in a scientific computing
context and give specific examples for molecular dynamics and Direct
Simulation Monte Carlo codes which result in dramatic performance
improvements versus simpler algorithms which do not scale as well. We
explain how a generic rendezvous algorithm can be implemented, and
also point out similarities with the MapReduce paradigm popularized by
Google and Hadoop.
