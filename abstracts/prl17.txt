We provide the first demonstration that molecular-level methods based
on gas kinetic theory and molecular chaos can simulate turbulence and
its decay. The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, a
molecular-level technique for simulating gas flows that resolves
phenomena from molecular to hydrodynamic (continuum) length scales, is
applied to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex flow. The DSMC simulations
reproduce the Kolmogorov âˆ’5=3 law and agree well with the turbulent
kinetic energy and energy dissipation rate obtained from direct
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations using a spectral
method. This agreement provides strong evidence that molecular-level
methods for gases can be used to investigate turbulent flows
quantitatively.
