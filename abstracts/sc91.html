<P>We briefly discuss three algorithms used to process synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) images: a polar reformatter that maps raw SAR data to a
rectangular mesh, 2-d FFTs that convert the data set to a real image,
and phase gradient autofocusing which creates clear images by
correcting blurs resulting from uncompensated phase
errors. Implementation details and performance data for the algorithms
are given for two parallel supercomputers, a nCUBE 2 hypercube and a
CM-2. Portions of the algorithms execute at gigaflop speeds, meaning
that large SAR data sets (16,384 x 65,536) can be processed in tens of
minutes instead of hours as on conventional supercomputers. Equally
significantly, the gigabytes of internal memory on the parallel
machines allow entire images to be processed in place.
