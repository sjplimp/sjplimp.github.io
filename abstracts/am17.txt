Nonvolatile redox transistors(NVRTs) based upon Li-ion battery
materials are demonstrated as memory elements for neuromorphic
computer architectures with multi-level analog states, "write"
linearity, low-voltage switching, and low power
dissipation. Simulations of backpropagation using the device
properties reach ideal classification accuracy. Physics-based
simulations predict energy costs per "write" operation of < 10 aJ when
scaled to 200 nm x 200 nm.
