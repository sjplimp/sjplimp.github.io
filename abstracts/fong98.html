<P>We describe recent algorithmic advances in the numerical solution of
the electronic structure for large systems. Numerous proof of
principle calculations that demonstrate linear-scaling already
exist. Most have focused on thigh-binding calculations not
DFT. Nevertheless, much of the developments do carry over to
DFT. Furthermore, the few DFT proof-of-principle calculations are
equally encouraging not withstanding the significant remaining
technical challenges. It is noteworthy that there is not one, now two,
but numerous approaches to eliminating the N3 scaling with an
N-scaling algorithm. In this chapter, we attempt to highlight the
underlying theme of N-scaling approaches while noting the many
differences. Evidently, the verdict is still out with regards to which
methods will endure and survive the test of time. It is also less than
obvious that there will ever exist one clear superior method. In all
likelihood, the preferred method will depend on the nature of the
application.  Our goal is to present basic principles so that whatever
the continued development in this active field, what we say herein
will remain relevant long into the future. We operate from the biased
expectation that a "good" algorithm will be robust, fairly general,
mathematically sound; preferable variational; accurate and that it
will strike a balance between efficiency and algorithmic simplicity.
