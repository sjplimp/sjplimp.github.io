<P>Self-diffusion parameters of Ag along Sigma 5 (310) (001) and Sigma 13
(320) (001) tilt grain boundaries are determined using both
molecular-statics (MS) and molecular-dynamics (MD) techniques with a
Ag potential based on the embedded-atom method. The MS calculations
provide the diffusion energetics in the low-temperature regime for
possible diffusion paths along the grain boundaries, while the MD
simulations provide information on the effect of temperature on the
diffusion parameters. The MD results indicate the diffusion mechanisms
change from low temperatures to high temperatures. In the low-
temperature regime, interstitial-related diffusion mechanisms are
dominant.  Vacancy-related diffusion mechanisms, while unimportant at
low temperatures, become dominant at high temperatures due to
increased vacancy concentration and mobility. These observations are
supported by changing slopes in the Arrhenius plots for both our
simulation results and experimental data. The calculated diffusion
parameters are in satisfactory agreement with available experimental
results.
