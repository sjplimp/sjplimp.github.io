[Molecular-dynamics simulations of grain-boundary diffusion in Al
using embedded-atom method potentials]

C. L. Liu and S. J. Plimpton, J Materials Research, 10, 1589-1592
(1995).

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of diffusion in a Sigma 5(310)
(001) Al tilt grain boundary were performed using for the first time
three different potentials based on the embedded atom method
(EAM). The EAM potentials that produce more accurate melting
temperatures also yield activation energies in better agreement with
experimental data. Compared to pair potentials, the EAM potentials
also give more accurate results.
