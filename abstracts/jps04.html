<P>The adhesion between a glassy polymer melt and substrate is studied in
the presence of end-grafted chains chemically attached to the
substrate surface. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations have been
carried out to study the effect of the areal density Sigma of tethered
chains and tensile pull velocity nu on the adhesive failure
mechanisms. The initial configurations are generated using a
double-bridging algorithm in which new bonds are formed across a pair
of monomers equidistant from their respective free ends. This
generates new chain configurations that are substantially different
than the original two chains such that the systems can be equilibrated
in a reasonable amount of cpu time. At the slowest tensile pull
velocity studied, a crossover from chain scission to crazing is
observed as the coverage increases, while for very large pull
velocity, only chain scission is observed. As the coverage increases,
the sections of the tethered chains pulled out from the interface form
the fibrils of a craze that are strong enough to suppress chain
scission, resulting in cohesive rather than adhesive failure.
