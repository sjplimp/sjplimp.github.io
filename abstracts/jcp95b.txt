Molecular dynamics simulations of binary, athermal blends of chains
consisting of 50 tangent sites were carried out over a range of
compositions at liquidlike packing fractions. The sites interact with
repulsive Lennard-Jones potentials and have effective hard sphere
diameters of approximately 1.0 and 1.2 for the two site types. The
intrachain and interchain correlation functions were found and, except
for the single component systems, the interchain correlations were
seen to de strongly dependent on system size. Trivial, long range
correlations due to the finite system size can be approximated from
simple physical arguments, and the coarse, interchain, radial
distribution functions can be ''corrected'' for these effects. The
resulting correlation functions are seen to behave at large separation
as would be expected of interchain radial distribution functions in an
infinite sized system, permitting meaningful comparisons with the
predictions of liquid state theory.
