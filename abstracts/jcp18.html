<P>A parallel implementation of coupled spin-lattice dynamics in the
LAMMPS molecular dynamics package is presented. The approach is very
general, and can be applied to simple ferromagnets, magnetic alloys,
or amorphous magnetic materials. Equations of motion for both spin
only and coupled spin-lattice dynamics are first reviewed, including a
detailed account of how magneto-mechanical potentials can be used to
perform a proper coupling between spin and lattice degrees of
freedom. A symplectic numerical integration algorithm is then
presented which combines the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for
non-commuting variables and conserves the geometric properties of the
equations of motion. The numerical accuracy of the serial
implementation was assessed by verifying that it conserves the total
energy and the norm of the total magnetization up to second order in
the timestep size. Finally, a very general parallel algorithm is
proposed that allows large spin-lattice systems to be efficiently
simulated on large numbers of processors without degrading its
mathematical accuracy. Its correctness as well as scaling efficiency
were tested for realistic coupled spin-lattice systems, confirming
that the new parallel algorithm is both accurate and efficient.
