The effect of structure and geometry on grain boundary self-diffusion
is investigated. Using static structures found by relaxation
techniques (conjugate gradients) as starting points for a molecular
dynamic simulation of a bicrystal model, diffusion coefficients and
activation energies are calculated for (100) fcc Al and bcc
$\alpha$-Fe tilt boundaries. These quantities are derived by
monitoring the mean-squared displacement of atoms in the grain
boundary region as the simulation progresses and as the temperature of
the simulated solid is changed. The angular, directional, and
structural dependence of the simulated diffusion are discussed and
compared to experimental measures and theoretical predictions. The
implementation of the molecular dynamics algorithm on a parallel
supercomputer is also briefly discussed to illustrate the performance
benefits these computers make possible.
