<P>Extensive molecular dynamics simulations are performed on a
glass-forming Lennard-Jones mixture to determine the nature of the
cooperative motions occurring in this model fragile liquid. We observe
stringlike cooperative molecular motion ("strings") at temperatures
well above the glass transition.  The mean length of the strings
increases upon cooling, and the string length distribution is found to
be nearly exponential.
