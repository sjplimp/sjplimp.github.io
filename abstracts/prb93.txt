We present a detailed description of the implementation on a parallel
supercomputer (hypercube) of the first-order equation-of-motion
solution to Schrodinger's equation, using plane-wave basis functions
and ab initio separable pseudopotentials. By distributing the plane
waves across the processors of the hypercube many of the computations
can be performed in parallel, resulting in decreases in the overall
computation time relative to conventional vector supercomputers. This
partitioning also provides ample memory for large
fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) meshes and the storage of plane- wave
coefficients for many hundreds of energy bands. The usefulness of the
parallel techniques is demonstrated by benchmark timings for both the
FFT's and iterations of the self-consistent solution of Schrodinger's
equation for different sized Si unit cells of up to 512 atoms.
