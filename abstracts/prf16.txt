The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) is investigated using the direct
simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of molecular gas dynamics. Here,
fully resolved two-dimensional DSMC RTI simulations are performed to
quantify the growth of flat and single-mode perturbed interfaces
between two atmospheric-pressure monatomic gases as a function of the
Atwood number and the gravitational acceleration. The DSMC simulations
reproduce many qualitative features of the growth of the mixing layer
and are in reasonable quantitative agreement with theoretical and
empirical models in the linear, nonlinear, and self-similar
regimes. In some of the simulations at late times, the instability
enters the self-similar regime, in agreement with experimental
observations. For the conditions simulated, diffusion can influence
the initial instability growth significantly.
