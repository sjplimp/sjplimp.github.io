This paper describes a method for incorporating a diffusion field
modeling oxygen usage and dispersion in a multi-scale model of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection mediated granuloma
formation. We implemented this method over a floating-point field to
model oxygen dynamics in host tissue during chronic phase response and
Mtb persistence. The method avoids the requirement of satisfying the
Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition, which is necessary in
implementing the explicit version of the finite-difference method, but
imposes an impractical bound on the time step. Instead, diffusion is
modeled by a matrixbased, steady state approximate solution to the
diffusion equation. Presented in figure 1 is the evolution of the
diffusion profiles of a containment granuloma over time.
