<P>In traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, atoms and
coarse-grained particles are modeled as point masses interacting via
isotropic potentials. For studies where particle shape plays a vital
role, more complex models are required. In this paper we describe a
spectrum of approaches for modeling aspherical particles, all of which
are now available (some recently) as options within the LAMMPS MD
package. Broadly these include two classes of models. In the first,
individual particles are aspherical, either via a pairwise anisotropic
potential which implicitly assigns a simple geometric shape to each
particle, or in a more general way where particles store internal
state which can explicitly define a complex geometric shape. In the
second class of models, individual particles are simple points or
spheres, but rigid body constraints are used to create composite
aspherical particles in a variety of complex shapes. We discuss
parallel algorithms and associated data structures for both kinds of
models, which enable dynamics simulations of aspherical particle
systems across a wide range of length and time scales. We also
highlight parallel performance and scalability and give a few
illustrative examples of aspherical models in different contexts.
