<P>We provide a demonstration that gas-kinetic methods incorporating
molecular chaos can simulate the sustained turbulence that occurs in
wall-bounded turbulent shear flows. The direct simulation Monte Carlo
method, a gas-kinetic molecular method that enforces molecular chaos
for gas-molecule collisions, is used to simulate the minimal Couette
flow at Re = 500. The resulting law of the wall, the average wall
shear stress, the average kinetic energy, and the continually
regenerating coherent structures all agree closely with corresponding
results from direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes
equations. These results indicate that molecular chaos for collisions
in gas-kinetic methods does not prevent development of molecular-scale
long-range correlations required to form hydrodynamic-scale turbulent
coherent structures.
