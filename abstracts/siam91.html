<P>Our charged particle simulation models a relativistic electron beam
for which the field solution is local and thus requires no grid. We
have implemented the simulation on a CRAY and on two parallel
machines, a nCUBE 2 and Connection Machine. We present implementation
details and contrast the approaches necessary for the three
architectures. On the parallel machines a dynamic load- balancing
problem arises because the beam grows uniformly in one dimension from
a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of particles as the simulation
progresses. We discuss a folded Gray-code mapping of the processors to
the length scale of the simulation that expands (or shrinks) as the
beam changes length so as to minimize inter-processor
communication. This improves the efficiency of the nCUBE version of
the simulation which runs at 10x the speed of the vectorized CRAY
version.
