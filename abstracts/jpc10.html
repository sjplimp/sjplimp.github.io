<P>Stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) is a relatively recent technique,
closely related to lattice Boltzmann, for capturing hydrodynamic fluid
flow at the mesoscale. The SRD method is based on simple constituent
fluid particle interactions and dynamics. Here we parametrize the SRD
fluid to provide a one to one match in the shear viscosity of a
Lennard-Jones fluid and present viscosity measurements for a range of
such parameters. We demonstrate how to apply the Muumlller-Plathe
reverse perturbation method for determining the shear viscosity of the
SRD fluid and discuss how finite system size and momentum exchange
rates effect the measured viscosity. The implementation and
performance of SRD in a parallel molecular dynamics code is also
described.
