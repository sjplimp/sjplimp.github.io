Electrical power efficiency is a primary concern in designing modern
HPC systems. Common strategies to improve CPU power efficiency rely on
increased parallelism within a processor that is enabled both by an
increase in the vector capabilities within the core and also the
number of cores within a processor. Although many-core processors have
been available for some time, achieving power-efficient performance
has been challenging due to the offload model. Here, we evaluate
performance of the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS on two new Intel(R)
processors including the second generation many-core Intel(R) Xeon
PhiTM processor that is available as a bootable CPU. We describe our
approach to measure power consumption out-of-band and software
optimizations necessary to achieve energy efficiency. We analyze
benefits from Intel(R) Advanced Vector Extensions 512 instructions and
demonstrate increased simulations rates with over 9X the CPU+DRAM
power efficiency when compared to the unoptimized code on previous
generation processors.
