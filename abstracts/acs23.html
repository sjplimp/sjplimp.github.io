<P>The topological constraints of nonconcatenated ring polymers force
them to form compact loopy globular conformations with much lower
entropy than unconstrained ideal rings. The closed-loop structure of
ring polymers also enables them to be threaded by linear polymers in
ring/linear blends, resulting in less compact ring conformations with
higher entropy. This conformational entropy increase promotes mixing
rings with linear polymers. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations
for bead-spring chains, ring/linear blends are shown to be
significantly more miscible than linear/linear blends and that there
is an entropic mixing, negative χ, for ring/linear blends compared to
linear/linear and ring/ring blends. In analogy with small angle
neutron scattering, the static structure function S(q) is measured,
and the resulting data are fit to the random phase approximation model
to determine χ. In the limit that the two components are the same, χ =
0 for the linear/linear and ring/ring blends as expected, while χ < 0
for the ring/linear blends. With increasing chain stiffness, χ for the
ring/linear blends becomes more negative, varying reciprocally with
the number of monomers between entanglements. Ring/linear blends are
also shown to be more miscible than either ring/ring or linear/linear
blends and stay in single phase for a wider range of increasing
repulsion between the two components.
