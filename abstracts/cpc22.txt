Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released
as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for
particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from
atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that
it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for
different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU
core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it
gives users control over simulation details, either via the input
script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints,
diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result,
hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it
has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines
today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in
LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made
it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some
capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this
flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly
visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy
machine learning interatomic potentials.
