<P>SPPARKS is an open-source parallel simulation code for developing and
run- ning various kinds of on-lattice Monte Carlo models at the atomic
or meso scales. It can be used to study the properties of solid-state
materials as well as model their dynamic evolution during
processing. The modular nature of the code allows new models and
diagnostic computations to be added without modification to its core
functionality, including its parallel algorithms. A vari- ety of
models for microstructural evolution (grain growth), solid-state dif-
fusion, thin film deposition, and additive manufacturing (AM)
processes are included in the code. SPPARKS can also be used to
implement grid-based algorithms such as phase field or cellular
automata models, to run either in tandem with a Monte Carlo method or
independently. For very large systems such as AM applications, the
Stitch I/O library is included, which enables only a small portion of
a huge system to be resident in memory. In this paper we describe
SPPARKS and its parallel algorithms and performance, explain how new
Monte Carlo models can be added, and highlight a variety of
applications which have been developed within the code.
