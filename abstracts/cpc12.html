<P>The use of accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) has
become popular in scientific computing applications due to their low
cost, impressive floating-point capabilities, high memory bandwidth,
and low electrical power requirements. Hybrid high-performance
computers, machines with nodes containing more than one type of
floating-point processor (e.g. CPU and GPU), are now becoming more
prevalent due to these advantages. In this paper, we present a
continuation of previous work implementing algorithms for using
accelerators into the LAMMPS molecular dynamics software for
distributed memory parallel hybrid machines. In our previous work, we
focused on acceleration for short-range models with an approach
intended to harness the processing power of both the accelerator and
(multi-core) CPUs. To augment the existing implementations, we present
an efficient implementation of long-range electrostatic force
calculation for molecular dynamics. Specifically, we present an
implementation of the particle-particle particle-mesh method based on
the work by Harvey and De Fabritiis. We present benchmark results on
the Keeneland InfiniBand GPU cluster. We provide a performance
comparison of the same kernels compiled with both CUDA and OpenCL. We
discuss limitations to parallel efficiency and future directions for
improving performance on hybrid or heterogeneous computers.
