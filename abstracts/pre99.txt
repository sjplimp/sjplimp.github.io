Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations of an equilibrium,
glass-forming Lennard-Jones mixture, we characterize in detail the
local atomic motions. We show that spatial correlations exist among
particles undergoing extremely large ("mobile") or extremely small
("immobile) displacements over a suitably chosen time interval. The
immobile particles form the cores of relatively compact clusters,
while the mobile particles move cooperatively and form quasi-one-
dimensional stringlike clusters. The strength and length scale of the
correlations between mobile particles are found to grow strongly with
decreasing temperature, and the mean cluster size appears to diverge
near the mode-coupling critical; temperature. We show that these
correlations in the particle displacements are related to equilibrium
fluctuations in the local potential energy and local composition.
