<P>Developing parallel software for unstructured problems continues to be
a difficult undertaking, particularly for distributed memory
machines. Framework and library support are limited for non-standard
applications and developers are often forced to code from
scratch. This is particularly true for complex, unstructured
applications. In this paper, we show that this needn't always be the
case. We describe a set of simple primitives which can be combined to
provide solutions to a variety of unstructured parallel computing
problems.  Specifically, we show how a small set of tools can yield
efficient parallel algorithms for particle modeling, crash simulations
and transferring data between two independent grids in multiphysics
simulations. The use of such tools allows the application developer to
program at a higher level without sacrificing performance.
