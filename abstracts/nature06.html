<P>As current experimental and simulation methods cannot determine the
mobility of. at boundaries across the large misorientation phase
space, we have developed a computational method for imposing an
artificial driving force on boundaries. In a molecular dynamics
simulation, this allows us to go beyond the inherent timescale
restrictions of the technique and induce non-negligible motion in. at
boundaries of arbitrary misorientation. For different series of
symmetric boundaries, we find both expected and unexpected results. In
general, mobility increases as the grain boundary plane deviates from
(111), but high-coincidence and low-angle boundaries represent special
cases. These results agree with and enrich experimental observations.
