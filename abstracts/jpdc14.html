<P>The need to process streaming data, which arrives continuously at
high-volume in real-time, arises in a variety of contexts including
data produced by experiments, collections of environmental or network
sensors, and running simulations. Streaming data can also be
formulated as queries or transactions which operate on a large dynamic
data store, e.g. a distributed database.
</P>
<P>We describe a lightweight, portable framework named PHISH which
provides a communication model enabling a set of independent processes
to compute on a stream of data in a distributedmemory parallel
manner. Datums are routed between processes in patterns defined by the
application.  PHISH provides multiple communication backends including
MPI and sockets/ZMQ. The former means streaming computations can be
run on any parallel machine which supports MPI; the latter allows them
to run on a heterogeneous, geographically dispersed network of
machines.
</P>
<P>We illustrate how streaming MapReduce operations can be implemented
using the PHISH communication model, and describe streaming versions
of three algorithms for large, sparse graph analytics: triangle
enumeration, sub-graph isomorphism matching, and connected component
finding.  Wealso provide benchmark timings comparing MPI and socket
performance for several kernel operations useful in streaming
algorithms.
