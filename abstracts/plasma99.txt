NIMROD is a code development project designed to study
long-wavelength, low- frequency, nonlinear phenomena in toroidal
plasmas with realistic geometry and dynamics. The numerical challenges
of solving the fluid equations for a fusion plasma are discussed and
our discretization scheme is presented. Simulations of a resistive
tearing mode show that time steps much greater than the Alfven time
are possible without loss of accuracy. Validation tests of a resistive
interchange mode in a shaped equilibrium, a ballooning mode and
nonlinear activity in reversed-field pinches are described.
