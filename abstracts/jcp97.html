<P>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on a blend of 50
unit, pearl-necklace chains with the object of examining-the effect of
intermolecular attractions on the blend structure and thermodynamics,
Repulsive interactions were imposed between intermolecular sites so
that the effective hard core diameter of B type chains was 1.2 times
that of the A type chains. Simulations were performed for a series of
runs in which the attractive interactions were systematically varied
from zero to the full Lennard-Jones value. Examination of the radial
distribution functions revealed that the attractive interactions had
very little effect on the blend structure up to the point of phase
separation.  Furthermore, we found that perturbation theory accurately
predicted the changes in pressure associated with the variations in
the attractive strengths.
