<P>The thermal conductivity of nanostructures generally decreases with
decreasing size because of classical size effects. The axial thermal
conductivity of polymer chain lattices, however, can exhibit the
opposite trend, because of reduced chain-chain anharmonic
scattering. This unique feature gives rise to an interesting
one-dimensional-to-three-dimensional transition in phonon
transport. We study this transition by calculating the thermal
conductivity of polyethylene with molecular dynamics simulations. The
results are important for designing inexpensive high
thermal-conductivity polymers.
