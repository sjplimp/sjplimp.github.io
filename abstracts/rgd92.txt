Recently a renewed interest has been exhibited in understanding both
contamination and space environmental effect in the low earth orbit
range of 220-600 km as well as in low-density microelectronics
manufacturing technologies. Realistic simulations must model the
physics of the highly coupled effects of neutral and charged particle
flows, thermodynamic non- equilibrium, surface charging, and
electromagnetic field effects. The computational requirements are
enormous for this level of modeling and are almost impossible to
achieve on current single processor supercomputers. An effort has been
initiated to develop this capability on a massively parallel
multiple-instruction/multiple-data (MIMD) supercomputer. The Wake
Shield Facility experiment will be used for test case
calculations. Preliminary results indicate that parallel
supercomputers may be the only computers capable of simulation the
required level of physics and spatial resolution.  Calculations which
contain from 1 to 8 million particles are presented.
