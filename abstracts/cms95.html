<P>S. J. Plimpton, Computational Materials Science, 4, 361-364 (1995).
</P>
<P>The system sizes and time scales accessible by classical molecular
dynamics techniques on current--generation parallel supercomputers are
briefly discussed. The implications for simulation of glasses and
glass--forming materials now and in the near future are highlighted.
