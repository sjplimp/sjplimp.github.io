<P>The bulk phase liquid crystalline behaviour of a cyclic siloxane with
a pentamethylcyclosiloxane core and biphenyl-4-allyloxybenzoate
mesogens (BCS) was studied using molecular dynamics (MD) and wide
angle X-ray analysis. This material exhibits partial crystallinity at
room temperature and liquid crystalline behaviour above 120 degrees
C. For the MD simulations an ensemble of 27 molecules with 135
mesogenic units was simulated and a molecular mechanics force field
was used to model the structural anisotropy of the siloxane
molecules. Simulations were carried out both at room temperature and
at an elevated temperature (425 K). Room temperature simulations
showed that, contrary to our initial assumptions, the low energy
molecular conformations were not cylindrical but splayed in
shape. During the simulation a smectic- like, tilted layer structure
was found to evolve for the cluster when full atom potentials were
used, while no such development was observed when electrostatic
interactions were neglected. The presence of a tilted layered
structure was also suggested by the X-ray data. These results indicate
that long range electrostatic interactions are significant for the
molecular system under study. In order to calculate the orientational
order parameter, the orientation of the molecular axis had to be
determined. This was achieved by describing the mesogen shapes to be
ellipsoidal and defining the principal axis of the ellipsoids to be
the molecular directors. By sampling over 200 ps of simulation at 425
K, the time averaged order parameter (S) was calculated. The
calculated S of 0.36 was comparable to the value of 0.4-0.45 found
from the experimental data. Apart from providing insight into the
relative importance of the various competing forces in the formation
of the liquid crystalline phase, these simulations are also expected
to be useful in predicting the mesophase behaviour of liquid
crystalline systems.
