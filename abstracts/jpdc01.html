<P>In this paper we present performance results from several parallel
benchmarks and applications on two large Linux clusters at Sandia
National Laboratories.  We compare the results on the Linux clusters
to performance obtained on a traditional distributed-memory massively
parallel processing machine, the Intel TeraFLOPS. We discuss the
characteristics of these machines that influence the performance
results and identify the key components of the system that are
important to allow for scalability of commodity-based PC clusters to
hundreds and possibly thousands of processors.
