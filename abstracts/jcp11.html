<P>Evaporation and condensation at a liquid/vapor interface are
ubiquitous interphase mass and energy transfer phenomena that are
still not well understood. We have carried out large scale molecular
dynamics simulations of Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids composed of
monomers, dimers, or trimers to investigate these processes with
molecular detail. For LJ monomers in contact with a vacuum, the
evaporation rate is found to be very high with significant evaporative
cooling and an accompanying density gradient in the liquid domain near
the liquid/vapor interface. Increasing the chain length to just dimers
significantly reduces the evaporation rate. We confirm that mechanical
equilibrium plays a key role in determining the evaporation rate and
the density and temperature profiles across the liquid/vapor
interface. The velocity distributions of evaporated molecules and the
evaporation and condensation coefficients are measured and compared to
the predictions of an existing model based on kinetic theory of
gases. Our results indicate that for both monatomic and polyatomic
molecules, the evaporation and condensation coefficients are equal
when systems are not far from equilibrium and smaller than one, and
decrease with increasing temperature. For the same reduced temperature
T/Tc, where Tc is the critical temperature, these two coefficients are
higher for LJ dimers and trimers than for monomers, in contrast to the
traditional viewpoint that they are close to unity for monatomic
molecules and decrease for polyatomic molecules. Furthermore, data for
the two coefficients collapse onto a master curve when plotted against
a translational length ratio between the liquid and vapor phase.
