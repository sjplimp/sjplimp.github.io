Simple polymer blends were studied by simulations with the intent of
probing the response of structurally asymmetric chains to
progressively stronger attractive interactions strengths. It was
found, for miscible blends, that the intermolecular pair correlation
functions, the g(r)'s, varied by less than 10% from those of the
associated blend with strictly repulsive interactions. When used for
the purposes of calculating changes in pressure due to the attractive
strength, the g(r)'s from either the repulsive or attractive systems
could be used interchangeably in the perturbation theory. On the other
hand, calculations of the enthalpic chi parameter were sensitive to
small variations in the g(r)'s, although, at least for the systems
studied here, the associated predictions of the phase boundaries were
relatively insensitive.
