<P>We present an algorithm to maintain the connected components of a
graph that arrives as an infinite stream of edges. We formalize the
algorithm on X-stream, a new parallel theoretical computational model
for infinite streams. Connectivityrelated queries, including component
spanning trees, are supported with some latency, returning the state
of the graph at the time of the query. Because an infinite stream may
eventually exceed the storage limits of any number of finite-memory
processors, we assume an aging command or daemon where “uninteresting”
edges are removed when the system nears capacity.  Following an aging
command the system will block queries until its data structures are
repaired, but edges will continue to be accepted from the stream,
never dropped. The algorithm will not fail unless a model-specific
constant fraction of the aggregate memory across all processors is
full. In normal operation, it will not fail unless aggregate memory is
completely full.
</P>
<P>Unlike previous theoretical streaming models designed for finite
graphs that assume a single shared memory machine or require
arbitrary-size intemediate files, X-stream distributes a graph over a
ring network of finite-memory processors. Though the model is
synchronous and reminiscent of systolic algorithms, our implementation
uses an asynchronous messagepassing system. We argue the correctness
of our X-stream connected components algorithm, and give preliminary
experimental results on synthetic and real graph streams.
