Molecular dynamics simulations of a binary, athermal blend of chains
consisting of 50 sites were carried out over a range of-compositions
at an overall packing fraction of 0.465, The species in the blend
interact with Lennard-Jones repulsive interactions chosen to give
effective hard core diameters of 1.015 and 1.215 for the A and B
sites, respectively. The intramolecular structure of the chains was
seen to be weakly dependent on composition, with the mean-square
end-to-end distance of the minority component at low volume fractions
tending towards that of the host component. The three intermolecular
radial distribution functions g(AA)(T), g(BB)(T), and g(AB)(r) were
observed to increase with increasing concentrations of the A
chains. Polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) calculations
were performed on this same blend and very good agreement was found
between the theory and the simulation over a range of compositions,
Significant nonrandom mixing was observed from the molecular dynamics
simulations on local length scales; PRISM theory was able to
accurately predict these nonrandom local features in the packing.
