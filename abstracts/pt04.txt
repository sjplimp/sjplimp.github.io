The transition from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D)
granular packings is studied using large-scale discrete element
computer simulations. We focus on vertical stress profiles and examine
how they change with dimensionality. We compare results for packings
in 2D, quasi-2D packings between flat plates, and 3D
packings. Analysis of these packings suggests that the Janssen theory
does not fully describe these packings, especially at the top of the
piles, where a hydrostaticlike region of vertical stress is visible in
all cases. We find that the interior of the packing is far from
incipient failure, while, in general, the forces at the walls are
close to incipient failure.
