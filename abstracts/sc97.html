<P>Transient solid dynamics simulations are among the most widely used
engineering calculations. Industrial applications include vehicle
crashworthiness studies, metal forging, and powder compaction prior to
sintering. These calculations are also critical to defense
applications including safety studies and weapons simulations. The
practical importance of these calculations and their computational
intensiveness make them natural candidates for parallelization.  This
has proved to be difficult, and existing implementations fail to scale
to more than a few dozen processors. In this paper we describe our
parallelization of PRONTO, Sandia's transient solid dynamics code, via
a novel algorithmic approach that utilizes multiple decompositions for
different key segments of the computations, including the material
contact calculation. This latter calculation is notoriously difficult
to perform well in parallel, because it involves dynamically changing
geometry, global searches for elements in contact, and unstructured
communications among the compute nodes. Our approach scales to at
least 3600 compute nodes of the Sandia/Intel Teraflop computer (the
largest set of nodes to which we have had access to date) on problems
involving millions of finite elements. On this machine we can simulate
models using more than ten-million elements in a few tenths of a
second per timestep, and solve problems more than 3000 times faster
than a single processor Cray Jedi.
