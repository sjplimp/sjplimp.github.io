This paper describes a successful approach to improving the robustness
and speed of Sandia National Laboratoryâ€™s 3-D MEMS geometry modeler
through a combination of mask subdivision and code
parallelization. Symptoms of the robustness problems experienced with
the original modeler that suggested the need for the subdivision
strategy pursued here are explained. The basic elements of the
subdivision approach and the subsequent parallel implementation are
described.  Results and timings for a number of different modeling
problems are presented and discussed in order to illustrate the
effectiveness of the current approach.
