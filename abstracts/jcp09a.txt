Three distinct forms are derived for the force virial contribution to
the pressure and stress tensor of a collection of atoms interacting
under periodic boundary conditions. All three forms are written in
terms of forces acting on atoms, and so are valid for arbitrary
many-body interatomic potentials. All three forms are mathematically
equivalent. In the special case of atoms interacting with pair
potentials, they reduce to previously published forms. i The atom-cell
form is similar to the standard expression for the virial for a finite
nonperiodic system, but with an explicit correction for interactions
with periodic images. ii The atom form is particularly suited to
implementation in modern molecular dynamics simulation codes using
spatial decomposition parallel algorithms.  iii The group form of the
virial allows the contributions to the virial to be assigned to
individual atoms.
