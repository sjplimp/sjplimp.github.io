<P>In this work we present a parallel algorithm for the Concurrent
Atomistic Continuum (CAC) formulation that can be integrated into
existing molecular dynamics codes. The CAC methodology is briefly
introduced and its parallel implementation in LAMMPS is detailed and
then demonstrated through benchmarks that compare CAC simulation
results with corresponding all-MD (molecular dynamics) results. The
parallel efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated when simulating
systems represented by both atoms and finite elements.  The
verification benchmarks include dynamic crack propagation and
branching in a Si single crystal, wave propagation and scattering in a
Si phononic crystal, and phonon transport through the phase interface
in a PbTe/PbSe heteroepitaxial system. In each of these benchmarks the
CAC algorithm is shown to be in good agreement with MD-only
models. This parallel CAC algorithm thus offers one of the first
scalable multiscale material simulation methodologies that relies
solely on atomic-interaction models.
