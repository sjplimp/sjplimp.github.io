We model indentation of a metal surface by combining an atomistic
metal with a hard-sphere indenter. This work provides atomistic
imaging of dislocation nucleation during displacement controlled
indentation on a passivated surface.  Dislocations and defects are
located and imaged by local deviations from centrosymmetry. For a
Au(111) surface, nucleation of partial dislocation loops occurs below
the surface inside the indenter contact area. We compare and contrast
these observations with empirical criteria for dislocation nucleation
and corresponding continuum elasticity solutions.
