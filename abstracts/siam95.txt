Grid partitioning is the method of choice for decomposing a wide
variety of computational problems into naturally parallel pieces. In
problems where computational load on the grid or the grid itself
changes as the simulation progresses, the ability to repartition
dynamically and in parallel is attractive for achieving higher
performance. We describe three algorithms suitable for parallel
dynamic load--balancing which attempt to partition unstructured grids
so that computational load is balanced and communication is
minimized. The execution time of the algorithms and the quality of the
partitions they generate are compared to results from serial
partitioners for two large grids. The integration of the algorithms
into a parallel particle simulation is also briefly discussed.
