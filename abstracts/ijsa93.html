<P>A spotlight synthetic aperture radar digital processor has been
implemented on an nCUBE 2 parallel supercomputer at Sandia National
Laboratories. The digital processor consists of three principal
components: a polar reformatter, a two- dimensional fast Fourier
transformation code, including Taylor weighting for side-lobe
reduction, and a phase gradient autofocus code. Several components of
the digital processor have also been implemented on other parallel
computers including a CM-2, an Intel iPSC/860 , and a Cray Y-MP/1. The
performance of the radar processor on all of these machines is
discussed.
