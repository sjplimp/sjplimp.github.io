<P>Simulations of interacting particles are common in science and
engineering, appearing in such diverse disciplines as astrophysics,
fluid dynamics, molecular physics, and materials science. These
simulations are often computationally intensive and so natural
candidates for massively parallel computing. Many--body simulations
that directly compute interactions between pairs of particles, be they
short--range or long--range interactions, have been parallelized in
several standard ways. The simplest approaches require all--to- -all
communication, an expensive communication step. The fastest methods
assign a group of nearby particles to a processor, which can lead to
load imbalance and be difficult to implement efficiently. We present a
new approach, suitable for direct simulations, that avoids
all--to--all communication without requiring any geometric
clustering. For some computations we find the new method to be the
fastest parallel algorithm available; we demonstrate its utility in
several parallel molecular dynamics simulations.
