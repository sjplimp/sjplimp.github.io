<P>The time evolution of species concentrations in biochemical reaction
networks is often modeled using the stochastic simulation algorithm
(SSA) <B>Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2340 (1977)</B>. The computational
cost of the original SSA scaled linearly with the number of reactions
in the network. Gibson and Bruck developed a logarithmic scaling
version of the SSA which uses a priority queue or binary tree for more
efficient reaction selection <B>Gibson and Bruck, J. Phys. Chem. A 104,
1876 (2000)</B>. More generally, this problem is one of dynamic discrete
random variate generation which finds many uses in kinetic Monte Carlo
and discrete event simulation. We present here a constant-time
algorithm, whose cost is independent of the number of reactions,
enabled by a slightly more complex underlying data structure. While
applicable to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in general, we describe
the algorithm in the context of biochemical simulations and
demonstrate its competitive performance on small- and medium-size
networks, as well as its superior constant-time performance on very
large networks, which are becoming necessary to represent the
increasing complexity of biochemical data for pathways that mediate
cell function.
