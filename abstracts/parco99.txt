The computing power available to scientists and engineers has
increased dramatically in the past decade, due in part to progress in
making massively parallel computing practical and available. The
expectation for these machines has been great. The reality is that
progress has been slower than expected.  Nevertheless, massively
parallel computing is beginning to realize its potential for enabling
significant breakthroughs in science and engineering.  This paper
provides a perspective on the state of the field, colored by the
authors' experiences using large scale parallel machines at Sandia
National Laboratories. We address trends in hardware, system software
and algorithms, and we also offer our view of the forces shaping the
parallel computing industry.
