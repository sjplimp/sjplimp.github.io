and Surface Engineering, 4, 37-54 (2011).

A three-dimensional parallel implementation of a Monte Carlo model for
the microstructure evolution during sintering is presented. The model
accounts for the main phenomena occurring during sintering, including
grain growth, pore migration and vacancy annihilation. The parallel
implementation is based on the SPPARKS code and enables the simulation
of systems with large number of particles. Several examples are shown
and results are compared with a serial implementation as well as
experimental data available.
