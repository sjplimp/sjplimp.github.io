The packing and flow of aspherical frictional particles are studied
using discrete element simulations. Particles are superballs with
shape vertical bar x vertical bar(s )+ vertical bar y vertical bar(s
)+ vertical bar z vertical bar(s)= 1 that varies from sphere (s = 2)
to cube (s = infinity), constructed with an overlapping-sphere
model. Both packing fraction, phi, and coordination number, z,
decrease monotonically with microscopic friction mu, for all
shapes. However, this decrease is more dramatic for larger s due to a
reduction in the fraction of face-face contacts with increasing
friction. For flowing grains, the dynamic friction fl-the ratio of
shear to normal stresses-depends on shape, microscopic friction, and
inertial number I. For all shapes, A grows from its quasistatic value
(mu) over tilde (0) as ((mu) over tilde - (mu) over tilde (0)) =
dI(alpha), with different universal behavior for frictional and
frictionless shapes. For frictionless shapes the exponent alpha
approximate to 0.5 and prefactor d approximate to 5 (mu) over tilde
(0) while for frictional shapes alpha approximate to 1 and d varies
only slightly. The results highlight that the flow exponents are
universal and are consistent for all the shapes simulated here.
