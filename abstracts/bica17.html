<P>Biological neural networks continue to inspire new developments in
algorithms and microelectronic hardware to solve challenging data
processing and classification problems. Here, we survey the history of
neural-inspired and neuromorphic computing in order to examine the
complex and intertwined trajectories of the mathematical theory and
hardware developed in this field. Early research focused on adapting
existing hardware to emulate the pattern recognition capabilities of
living organisms.  Contributions from psychologists, mathematicians,
engineers, neuroscientists, and other professions were crucial to
maturing the field from narrowly-tailored demonstrations to more
generalizable systems capable of addressing difficult problem classes
such as object detection and speech recognition.  Algorithms that
leverage fundamental principles found in neuroscience such as
hierarchical structure, temporal integration, and robustness to error
have been developed, and some of these approaches are achieving
world-leading performance on particular data classification tasks. In
addition, novel microelectronic hardware is being developed to perform
logic and to serve as memory in neuromorphic computing systems with
optimized system integration and improved energy efficiency. Key to
such advancements was the incorporation of new discoveries in
neuroscience research, the transition away from strict structural
replication and towards the functional replication of neural systems,
and the use of mathematical theory frameworks to guide algorithm and
hardware developments.
