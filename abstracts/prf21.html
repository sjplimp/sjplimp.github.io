<P>In typical turbulent flows, noncontinuum effects are extremely small
and hence can be ignored. However, for some high-Mach-number flows,
the Kolmogorov length scale is of the same order as the molecular mean
free path, which could introduce noncontinuum molecular-level effects
into the turbulent energy cascade. To investigate this, the
compressible Taylor-Green vortex flow is simulated for near-continuum
conditions using both noncontinuum molecular gas dynamics (direct
simulation Monte Carlo method) and continuum computational fluid
dynamics (direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes
equations). Although the energy-decay histories are basically the
same, molecular-level fluctuations are observed to break the
symmetries of the initial conditions and thereby produce different but
statistically similar routes (based on velocity spectra) from the
initial nonturbulent flow to the long-time turbulent flow.
