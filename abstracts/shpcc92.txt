[Monte Carlo Particle Simulation of Low-Density Fluid Flow on MIMD
Supercomputers]

Computing Conference, Williamsburg, VA, April 1992, p 212.

Direct Simulation Monte Carlo is a well-established technique for
modeling low density fluid flows. The parallel implementation of a
general simulation which allows for body-fitted grids, particle
weighting, and a variety of surface and flow chemistry models is
described. We compare its performance on a 1024-node nCUBE 2 to a
serial version for the CRAY-YMP. Experiences with load-balancing the
computation via graph-based heuristics (Kernighan and Lin) and the
newer spectral techniques (Pothen, Simon, and Liou) are also
discussed. This is a critical issue since density fluctuations can
create orders-of-magnitude differences in computational loads as the
simulation progresses.
