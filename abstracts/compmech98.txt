An efficient, scalable, parallel algorithm for treating material
surface contacts in solid mechanics finite element programs has been
implemented in a modular way for multiple-instruction, multiple-data
(MIMD) paralllel computers.  The serial contact detection algorithm
that was developed previously for the transient dynamics finite
element code PRONTO3D has been exteneded for use in parallel
computation by utilizing a dynamic (adaptive) load balancing
algorithm. This approach is scalable to thousands of computational
nodes.
