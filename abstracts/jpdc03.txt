We present a parallel algorithm for performing multipoint linkage
analysis of genetic marker data on large family pedigrees. The
algorithm effectively distributes both the computation and memory
requirements of the analysis. We discuss an implementation of the
algorithm in the Genehunter linkage analysis package (version 2.1),
enabling Genehunter to run on distributed memory platforms for the
first time. Our preliminary benchmarks indicate reasonable scalability
of the algorithm even for fixed-size problems, with parallel
efficiencies of 75\% or more on up to 128 processors. In addition, we
have extended the hard-coded limit of 16 non-founding individuals in
Genehunter 2.1 to a new limit of 32 non-founding individuals.
