<P>Resistive memories enable dramatic energy reductions for neural
algorithms. We propose a general purpose neural architecture that can
accelerate many different algorithms and determine the device
properties that will be needed to run backpropagation on the neural
architecture. To maintain high accuracy, the read noise standard
deviation should be less than 5% of the weight range. The write noise
standard deviation should be less than 0.4% of the weight range and up
to 300% of a characteristic update (for the datasets
tested). Asymmetric nonlinearities in the change in conductance vs
pulse cause weight decay and significantly reduce the accuracy, while
moderate symmetric nonlinearities do not have an effect. In order to
allow for parallel reads and writes the write current should be less
than 100 nA as well.
