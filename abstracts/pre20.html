<P>Intuition tells us that a rolling or spinning sphere will eventually
stop due to the presence of friction and other dissipative
interactions. The resistance to rolling and spinning or twisting
torque that stops a sphere also changes the microstructure of a
granular packing of frictional spheres by increasing the number of
constraints on the degrees of freedom of motion. We perform discrete
element modeling simulations to construct sphere packings implementing
a range of frictional constraints under a pressure-controlled
protocol. Mechanically stable packings are achievable at volume
fractions and average coordination numbers as low as 0.53 and 2.5,
respectively, when the particles experience high resistance to
sliding, rolling, and twisting. Only when the particle model includes
rolling and twisting friction were experimental volume fractions
reproduced.
