Peridynamics (PD) is a continuum theory that employs a nonlocal model
to describe material properties.  In this context, nonlocal means that
continuum points separated by a finite distance may exert force upon
each other.  A meshless method results when PD is discretized with
material behavior approximated as a collection of interacting
particles.  This paper describes how PD can be implemented within a
molecular dynamics (MD) framework, and provides details of an
efficient implementation. This adds a computational mechanics
capability to an MD code, enabling simulations at mesoscopic or even
macroscopic length and time scales.
