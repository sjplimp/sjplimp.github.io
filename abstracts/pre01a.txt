We have performed a systematic, large-scale simulation study of
granular media in two and three dimensions, investigating the rheology
of cohesionless granular particles in inclined plane geometries, i.e.,
chute flows. We find that over a wide range of parameter space of
interaction coefficients and inclination angles, a steady-state flow
regime exists in which the energy input from gravity balances that
dissipated from friction and inelastic collisions. In this regime, the
bulk packing fraction (away from the top free surface and the bottom
plate boundary) remains constant as a function of depth z, of the
pile. The velocity profile in the direction of flow v{sub x}(z) scales
with height of the pile H, according to v{sub x}(z) varies as H{sup
alpha }, with alpha =1.52+or-0.05. However, the behavior of the normal
stresses indicates that existing simple theories of granular flow do
not capture all of the features evidenced in the simulations.
