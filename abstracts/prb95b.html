<P>A systematic first-principles pseudopotential plane-wave and linear
combination of atomic orbitals basis-set convergence study has been
performed for a 64-atom amorphous "tetrahedral" carbon network
(Drabold et al.). Converged results of the two methods are consistent
with each other and indicate that when large, site-dependent
bond-angle and bond-length distortions are present, variational
freedom within a basis-set representation is crucial for an accurate
representation of atomic forces. Minimal basis-set/non-self-consistent
methods are not adequate for these systems, but are more applicable to
systems with minimal site-dependent, electron-density distortions.
