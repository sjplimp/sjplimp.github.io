Discrete ordinates methods are commonly used to simulate radiation
transport for fire or weapons modeling. The computation proceeds by
sweeping the flux across a grid. A particular cell can't be computed
until all the cells immediately upwind of it are finished. If the
directed dependence graph for the grid cells contains a cycle then
sweeping methods will deadlock. This can happen in unstructured grids
and time stepped problems where the grid is allowed to deform. In this
paper we present a parallel algorithm to detect cycles in the
dependence graphs present in these grids as well as an implementation
and experimental results on shared and distributed memory machines.
