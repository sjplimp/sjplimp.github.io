The aggregation of liquid crystal nanodroplets from a homogenous
solution are studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The liquid
crystal particles are modeled as elongated ellipsoidal Gay-Berne
particles while the solvent is modeled as spherical Lennard-Jones
particles. Extending previous studies of (Berardi et. al.,
J. Chem. Phys. 126, 044905 (2007)), we find that liquid crystal
nanodroplets are not stable and that after sufficiently long times the
nanodroplets always aggregate into a single large droplet. Results
describing the droplet shape and orientation for different
temperatures and shear rates are presented. The implementation of the
Gay-Berne potential for biaxial ellipsoidal particles in a parallel
molecular dynamics code is also briefly discussed.
