<P>The method of discrete ordinates is commonly used to solve the
Boltzmann radiation transport equation for applications ranging from
simulations of fires to weapons effects. The equations are most
efficiently solved by sweeping the radiation flux across the
computational grid. For unstructured grids this poses several
interesting challenges, particularly when implemented on distributed-
memory parallel machines where the grid geometry is spread across
processors.  We describe an asynchronous, parallel, message-passing
algorithm that performs sweeps simultaneously from many directions
across unstructured grids. We identify key factors that limit the
algorithm's parallel scalability and discuss two enhancements we have
made to the basic algorithm: one to prioritize the work within a
processor's subdomain and the other to better decompose the
unstructured grid across processors. Performance results are given for
the basic and enhanced algorithms implemented within a radiation
solver running on hundreds of processors of Sandia's Intel Tflops
machine and DEC-Alpha CPlant cluster.
