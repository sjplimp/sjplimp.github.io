[Microbial cell modeling via reacting diffusing particles]

S. J. Plimpton and A. Slepoy, Journal of Physics: Conference Series
16, 305-309 (2005).

We describe a particle-based simulator called ChemCell that we are
developing with the goal of modeling the protein chemistry of
biological cells for phenomena where spatial effects are important.
Membranes and organelle structure are represented by triangulated
surfaces.  Diffusing particles represent proteins, complexes, or other
biomolecules of interest.  Particles interact with their neighbors in
accord with Monte Carlo rules to perform biochemical reactions which
can represent protein complex formation and dissociation, ligand
binding, etc.  In this brief paper we give the motivation for
such a model, describe a few of the code's features, and highlight
interesting computational issues that arise in particle-based cell
modeling.
