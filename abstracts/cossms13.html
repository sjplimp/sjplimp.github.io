<P>For this article, we call scientific software a community code if it
is freely available, written by a team of developers who welcome user
input, and has attracted users beyond the developers. There are
obviously many such materials modeling codes. The authors have been
part of such efforts for many years in the field of atomistic
simulation, specifically for two community codes, the LAMMPS and GULP
packages for molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics
respectively. Here we highlight lessons we have learned about how to
create such codes and the pros and cons of being part of a community
effort. Many of our experiences are similar, but we also have some
differences of opinion (like modeling vs modelling). Our hope is that
readers will find these lessons useful as they design, implement, and
distribute their own materials modelling software for others to
use.
