[Fast Parallel Algorithms for Short-Range Molecular Dynamics]

S. J. Plimpton, J Comp Phys, 117, 1-19 (1995).

Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are
presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms;
the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter--atomic forces to
compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms
are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to
parallelize efficiently --- those with short--range forces where the
neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any
distributed--memory parallel machine which allows for message--passing
of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are
tested on a standard Lennard--Jones benchmark problem for system sizes
ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel
supercomputers --- the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray
T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray
Y--MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel
machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even
for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves
parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840--node Intel Paragon performs
up to 165 faster than a single Cray C90 processor. Trade--offs between
the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex
molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.
