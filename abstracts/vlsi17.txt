Analog resistive memories promise to reduce the energy of neural
networks by orders of magnitude. However, the write variability and
write nonlinearity of current devices prevent neural networks from
training to high accuracy. We present a novel periodic carry method
that uses a positional number system to overcome this while
maintaining the benefit of parallel analog matrix operations. We
demonstrate how noisy, nonlinear TaOx devices that could only train to
80% accuracy on MNIST, can now reach 97% accuracy, only 1% away from
an ideal numeric accuracy of 98%. On a file type dataset, the TaOx
devices achieve ideal numeric accuracy. In addition, low noise, linear
Li1-xCoO2 devices train to ideal numeric accuracies using periodic
carry on both datasets.
