<P>Microstructural morphology and grain boundary properties often control
the service properties of engineered materials. This report uses the
Potts-model to simulate the development of microstructures in
realistic materials. Three areas of microstructural morphology
simulations were studies. They include the development of massively
parallel algorithms for Potts-model grain grow simulations, modeling
of mass transport via diffusion in these simulated microstructures,
and the development of a gradient-dependent Hamiltonian to simulate
columnar grain growth.

<P>Potts grain growth models for massively parallel supercomputers were developed
for the conventional (non-accelerated) Potts-model in both two and three
dimensions. Simulations using these parallel codes showed self similar grain
growth and no finite size effects for previously unapproachable large scale
problems. In addition, new enhancements to the conventional Metropolis
algorithm used in the Potts-model were developed to accelerate the
calculations. These techniques enable both the sequential and parallel
algorithms to run faster and use essentially an "infinite" number of grain
orientation values to avoid non-physical gain coalescence events.
Mass transport phenomena in polycrystalline materials were studied in two
dimensions using numerical diffusion techniques on microstructures generated
using the Potts-model. The results of the mass transport modeling showed
excellent quantitative agreement with one dimensional diffusion problems,
however the results also suggest that transient multi-dimension diffusion
effects cannot be parameterized as the product of the grain boundary diffusion
coefficient and the grain boundary width. Instead, both properties are
required.

<P>Gradient-dependent grain growth mechanisms were included in the Potts-model by
adding an extra term to the Hamiltonian (total internal energy). Under normal
grain growth, the primary driving term is the curvature of the grain boundary,
which is included in the standard Potts-model Hamiltonian. To investigate
columnar growth, a gradient-dependent term was added. This approach was taken
because it fit easily into the mobility model in which the velocity of the
grain boundary is proportional to its mobility times the driving forces.
Results of these simulations produced the expected columnar grain structures in
regions of high mobility and large temperature gradients.
