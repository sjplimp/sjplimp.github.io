<P>A parallel implementation of a Monte Carlo algorithm for modeling the
scattering of electrons in solids and the resulting X-ray production
is described. Two important issues for accurate and fast parallel
simulation are discussed - random number generation and
load-balancing. Timing results for the parallel simulation are given
which show even modest sized parallel machines can be competitive with
conventional vector supercomputers for Monte Carlo trajectory
simulations. Examples of parallel calculations performed to analyze
specimen composition data and to characterize electron microscope
performance are briefly highlighted.
