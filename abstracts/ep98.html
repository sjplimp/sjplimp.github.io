<P>We present results of molecular dynamics simulations of strong,
flexible polyelectrolyte chains in solution with added salt. The
effect of added salt on the polyelectrolyte chain structure is fully
treated for the first time as a function of polymer density. Systems
above and below the Manning condensation limit are studied. The chain
structure is intimately tied to the ion density near the chain even
for chains in the counterion condensation (CC) regime. The end-to-end
distance is demonstrated to be a function of the inverse Debye
screening length and the Bjerrum length. The ion density near the
polymer chain depends on the amount of added salt, and above the
condensation limit the chains significantly contract due to added
salt.
