<P>Some basic issues involved in matching an application to a distributed
memory parallel machine are addressed in this paper. In particular,
data communication and processor synchronization as they relate to
MIMD (multiple instruction - multiple data) and SIMD (single
instruction - multiple data) architectures are discussed. To
illustrate the differences, we describe the implementation and
performance of several engineering and scientific applications that
have been coded for both kinds of machines. We find that many problems
are well suited to both architectures. However, when the natural
parallelism in a simulation requires a loose synchronization between
processors, the MIMD paradigm offers a greater programming flexibility
than SIMD.
