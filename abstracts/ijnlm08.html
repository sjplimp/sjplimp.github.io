<P>This paper reports a new research effort aimed at using efficient
multibody dynamics methods to simulate coarse-grained molecular
systems. Various molecular systems are studied and the results of
nanosecond-long simulations are analyzed to validate the method. The
systems studied include bulk water, alkane chains, alanine dipeptide
and carboxyl terminal fragments of calmodulin, ribosomal L7/L12 and
rhodopsin proteins. The stability and validity of the simulations are
studied through conservation of energy, thermodynamics properties and
conformational analysis. In these simulations, a speed up of an order
of magnitude is realized for conservative error bounds with a fixed
timestep integration scheme. A discussion is presented on the
open-source software developed to facilitate future research using
multibody dynamics with molecular dynamics.
