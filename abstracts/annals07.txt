The NF-kB signaling network plays an important role in many different
compartments of the immune system during immune activation. Using a
computational model of the NF-kB signaling network involving two
negative regulators, IkB and A20, we performed sensitivity analyses
with three different sampling methods and present a ranking of the
kinetic rate variables by the strength of their influence on the NF-kB
signaling response. We also present a classif ication of
temporal-response profiles of nuclear NF-kB concentration into six
clusters, which can be regrouped to three biologically relevant
clusters. Last, we constructed a reduced network of the IKK-NF-kB-A20
signal transduction based on the ranking.
