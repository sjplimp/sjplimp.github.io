The multiplication of a vector by a matrix is the kernel operation in
many algorithms used in scientific computation. A fast and efficient
parallel algorithm for this calculation is therefore desirable. This
paper describes a parallel matrix-vector multiplication algorithm
which is particularly well suited to dense matrices or matrices with
an irregular sparsity pattern. Such matrices can arise from
discretizing partial differential equations on irregular grids or from
problems exhibiting nearly random connectivity between data
structures. The communication cost of the algorithm is independent of
the matrix sparsity pattern and is shown to scale as O(N/sqrt(P) +
log(P)) for an N x N matrix on P processors. The algorithm's
performance is demonstrated by using it within the well known NAS
conjugate gradient benchmark. This resulted in the fastest run times
achieved to date on both the 1024 node nCUBE~2 and the 128 node Intel
iPSC/860. Additional improvements to the algorithm which are possible
when integrating it with the conjugate gradient algorithm are also
discussed.
