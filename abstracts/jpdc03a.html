<P>A number of computational procedures employ multiple grids on which
solutions are computed. For example, in multi-physics simulations a
primary grid may be used to compute mechanical deformation of an
object while a secondary grid is used for thermal conduction
calculations. When modeling coupled thermo-mechanical effects,
solution data must be interpolated back and forth between the grids
each timestep. On a parallel machine, this grid transfer operation can
be challenging if the two grids are decomposed across processors
differently for reasons of computational efficiency. If the grids move
or adapt separately, the complexity of the operation is compounded. In
this paper, we describe two grid transfer algorithms suitable for
massively parallel simulations which use multiple grids. They use a
rendezvous technique wherein a third decomposition is used to search
for elements in one grid that contain nodal points of the other. This
has the advantage of enabling the grid transfer operation to be
load-balanced separately from the remainder of the computations. The
algorithms are designed for use within the multi-physics code SIERRA,
an object-oriented framework developed at Sandia. Performance and
scalability results are given for the grid transfer operation running
on up to 1024 processors of two large parallel machines, the Intel
Tflops (ASCI Red) and DEC-Alpha CPlant cluster.
