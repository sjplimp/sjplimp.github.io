Parallel computing offers new capabilities for using molecular
dynamics (MD) to simulate larger numbers of atoms and longer time
scales. In this paper we discuss two methods we have used to implement
the embedded atom method (EAM) formalism for molecular dynamics on
multiple-instruction/multiple-data (MIMD) parallel computers. The
first method (atom-decomposition) is simple and suitable for small
numbers of atoms. The second method (force-decomposition) is new and
is particularly appropriate for the EAM because all the computations
are between pairs of atoms. Both methods have the advantage of not
requiring any geometric information about the physical domain being
simulated. We present timing results for the two parallel methods on a
benchmark EAM problem and briefly indicate how the methods can be used
in other kinds of materials MD simulations.
