Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is a simulation technique that
uses particles to model fluids at low densities where continuum
formulations break down. Monte Carlo rules are used to perform
particle collisions and chemical reactions and a grid is used to
locate nearby particles. We describe our implementation of a
large-scale DSMC model on the thousand-processor nCUBE 2 and Intel
Paragon machines. It includes body-fitted irregular grids and particle
weighting to reduce the numbers of particles and grid cells that must
be used. Our parallel methods for load-balancing and performing
irregular communication on the distributed-memory machines are also
discussed. The parallel machines have enabled us to run large
simulations (10^7 particles, 10^4 grid cells, 10^4 timesteps) at
speeds up to 40 times faster (on our nCUBE 2) than on a Cray Y-MP
processor. For illustration purposes, we include results from some of
these large-scale simulations.
