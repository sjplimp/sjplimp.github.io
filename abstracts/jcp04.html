<P>A conforming representation composed of 2D finite elements and finite
Fourier series is applied to 3D nonlinear non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamics using a semi-implicit time-advance. The
self-adjoint semi-implicit operator and variational approach to
spatial discretization are synergistic and enable simulation in the
extremely stiff conditions found in high temperature plasmas without
sacrificing the geometric flexibility needed for modeling laboratory
experiments. Growth rates for resistive tearing modes with
experimentally relevant Lundquist number are computed accurately with
time-steps that are large with respect to the global Alfven time and
moderate spatial resolution when the finite elements have basis
functions of polynomial degree (p) two or larger. An error diffusion
method controls the generation of magnetic divergence
error. Convergence studies show that this approach is effective for
continuous basis functions with p greater than or equal to 2, where
the number of test functions for the divergence control terms is less
than the number of degrees of freedom in the expansion for vector
fields. Anisotropic thermal conduction at realistic ratios of parallel
to perpindicular conductivity (chi(\\)/chi(perpendicular to)) is
computed accurately with p greater than or equal to 3 without mesh
alignment. A simulation of tearing -mode evolution for a shaped
toroidal tokamak equilibrium demonstrates the effectiveness of the
algorithm in nonlinear conditions, and its results are used to verify
the accuracy of the numerical anisotropic thermal conduction in 3D
magnetic topologies.
