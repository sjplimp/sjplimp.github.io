<P>Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is a particle-based technique for
simulating low-density fluid flows -- those with a ratio of mean-free
path to geometry scale (the Knudsen number) of order 0.1 or
greater. The basic idea is simple.  Particles of various chemical
species stream through a simulation domain bounded by inflow, outflow,
or body surfaces. In a single timestep, each particle moves
independently (without inter-particle collisions) to a new
position. The move may include boundary interactions such as bouncing
off a surface. At the end of the timestep an artificial grid is
superposed on the simulation domain and used to locate particles that
are near each other.  Particles within a grid cell collide with each
other and perform chemistry reactions via Monte Carlo (random)
rules. Similarly, particles in grid cells that border a boundary
surface can undergo surface chemistry interactions during the particle
move. Statistics are gathered and a new timestep begins.  Over the
course of a many-timestep simulation, statistics accumulated within
cells and at surfaces are used to compute various thermodynamic
quantities of interest for all chemical species, such as flow
temperature, density, and velocity.
</P>
<P>A Sandia DSMC code, called ICARUS, grids a 2-d domain with a
collection of adjoining body-fitted grids (see the 1st figure
below). Axi-symmetric problems can be simulated in 3-d by rotating the
grid around an axis of symmetry and applying 3-d boundary
conditions. ICARUS also allows for particle and cell weighting factors
which enable trace species to be accurately tracked with minimal
computational effort.
</P>
<P>ICARUS is parallelized by assigning a subset of grid cells and the
particles in those cells to each processor. This can raise
load-balancing issues as particle densities vary in space and
time. Our strategies for achieving reasonable load- balance and good
parallel performance are detailed in the papers below. On big problems
(tens of thousands of grid cells, millions of particles) ICARUS
typically runs efficiently on hundreds to thousands of processors. It
has been a workhorse code at Sandia on a series of parallel machines,
from the nCUBE 2 to the Intel Paragon to the Intel Tflops.

<P>Here is a snapshot of particle density (on a log scale) around a nose
cone as it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. The particle-tracking
grid is shown in the lower half.

<P>This is the temperature profile of a gas escaping from an orifice
nozzle into vacuum with stream lines in black. The white region at the
upper left of the figure is the nozzle; the inlet orifice is at the
far left; the y-axis is a line of axi-symmetry.

<P>This is a calculation of flow around a wake shield that was deployed
on the space shuttle. The idea was to see if very low densities could
be achieved in the wake of the shield as it swept through the upper
atmosphere. These calculations of particle density showed a 6
order-of-magnitude reduction in density behind the shield, from the
reference ambient density.

<P>A more down-to-earth setting where low-density flows are important is
in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors for semiconductor
processing. This is the pressure profile from a simulation of flow
across a silicon wafer. Gas is injected at the top of the figure thru
small orifices, flows across the surface of the wafer, and is pumped
out at the lower right. Again, the left vertical axis is a line of
axi-symmetry.
