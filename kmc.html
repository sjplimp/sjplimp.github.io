<H3>Kinetic Monte Carlo 
</H3>
<P>Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is a method for stochastically modeling
"events" in a way that correctly samples the relative probabilities of
each event occurring.  An event can be a diffusive hop by an atom, the
deposition of an atom, a spin flip in a lattice model, a chemical
reaction in a biochemical network, or even a person buying a widget in
a discrete-event model.
</P>
<P>KMC models are typically "coarse-grain" in that an entire event occurs
in one iteration/timestep of the simulation code, without the need to
track low-level dynamics leading up to the event, e.g. atomic
vibrations.
</P>
<P>We've written an open-source KMC simulator called
<A HREF = "http://spparks.sandia.gov">SPPARKS</A> which can perform both KMC and
Metropolis Monte Carlo updating of various models.  The goal of
SPPARKS is to provide a framework where basic algorithms for KMC and
MMC are provided both in serial and parallel, and which allows new
applications to be easily added.  Our main focus thus far has been
on-lattice KMC for materials phenonmena like grain growth, surface
growth and deposition, and void growth.  But we have also been working
to develop off-lattice KMC applications as well.

pages</A> describes the
software in more detail.
