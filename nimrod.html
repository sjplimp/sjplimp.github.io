<H3>NIMROD - plasma simulation of tokamaks 
</H3>
<P>NIMROD (non-ideal MHD with rotation - open discussion) is a multi-lab
project sponsored by DOE's Office of Fusion Energy to create a new
plasma simulation tool for tokamaks and alternates. This is the <A HREF = "http://nimrodteam.org">home
page</A> for the NIMROD project; it lists the team members and
describes the code's physics equations, computational techniques, and
some calculations performed to date.
</P>


<P>My contribution has been to the parallelization effort. NIMROD grids
the poloidal plane of the tokamak with finite-element quads and
triangles (in the center region or at the external boundary) as in the
figure below. The toroidal direction is discretized with spectral
modes. The decomposition of the 3- d domain to processors is done as a
pre-processing step so that each processor owns one or more sub-blocks
of elements and one or more of the modes associated with those
elements.

<P>Interprocessor communication across the irregular sub-block boundaries
occurs in the linear solver to fully form the matrix and right-hand
side for each unknown and to perform matrix-vector multiplies. This
so-called "seaming" procedure is shown pictorially in the figure
below. Each sub-block adjoins other sub-blocks in an irregular
fashion. A 1-d seam stores copies of the boundary values for each
sub-block. Portions of each seam are exchanged with neighboring
processors to fully sum the boundary values in each sub-block. For
example, the green point is a summation on 2 procs; the red point is a
summation across 3 procs. This seaming is done via message-passing
using some efficient library routines I developed for irregular
communcation. (See our <A HREF = "algorithms.html#grid">grid transfer</A> and <A HREF = "pronto.html">PRONTO transient
dynamics</A> work for other applications of these ideas.)
Additional communication across spectral modes is also done within
NIMROD to perform on-processor 1-d FFTs within each finite element.

<P>NIMROD is written in F90 with MPI calls. It runs portably on many
machines; the biggest calculations to date have been run on the Cray
T3E at NERSC. For large problems the code runs scalably on up to 256
processors of the T3E. A pretty picture of some tokamak modes is shown
below; details are given on the <A HREF = "http://nimrodteam.org">NIMROD home page</A>.

<P>The linear algebra kernel within NIMROD is a conjugate gradient
solver. Other team members have written several preconditioners for
the solver, including Jacobi, line, and block-inversion
preconditioners. Currently I'm working to integrate the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/CRF/aztec1.html">AZTEC</A>
parallel linear solver package into NIMROD so we can experiment with
2-level multigrid and other preconditioning options.
