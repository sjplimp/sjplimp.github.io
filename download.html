<A NAME = "pd"></A><H3>ParaDyn - embedded atom method (EAM) molecular dynamics 
</H3>
<P>ParaDyn is a parallel F77 code that implements all the features of the
popular serial EAM code for metals and metal alloys known as DYNAMO.
DYNAMO was written by two of the EAM originators, Stephen Foiles and
Murray Daw.  ParaDyn's parallelism is based on the atom- and
force-decomposition algorithms discussed on <A HREF = "md.html">this page</A> and in
the 1993 MRS paper listed below.
</P>
<P>Nearly all of ParaDyn's functionality is now in <A HREF = "#lmp">LAMMPS</A>, which
runs 2-4x faster than ParaDyn both on a single processor and in
parallel.  This is due to force computations and neighbor list
building being implemented in a different way.  So only download
ParaDyn if you're sure it's what you want.

<A NAME = "lj"></A><H3>Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics parallel algorithm codes 
</H3>
<P>These are 3 parallel Lennard-Jones codes discussed in the 1995 J Comp
Phys paper listed below.  Each code performs the same computations,
but implements either a atom-, force-, or spatial-decomposition
algorithm.  The algorithms are discussed briefly on <A HREF = "md.html">this
page</A> and fully in the paper.  These codes were written before
MPI was around, so the codes have their own message-passing libraries
with a wrapper on a vanilla MPI send and receive that was added later.

<A NAME = "gups"></A><H3>HPCC RandomAccess (GUPS) Benchmark 
</H3>
<P>I wrote an optimized version of this <A HREF = "http://icl.cs.utk.edu/hpcc/index.html">HPCC</A> benchmark using a
synchronous hypercube-style all2all algorithm.  It enables scalable
GUPS performance on large numbers of processors.  The tar file
includes files for a simple stand-alone code for quick testing, as
well as modules that can be incorporated into the HPCC harness for
running an official benchmark test.
</P>
<P>The algorithm is described briefly on <A HREF = "algorithms.html#gups">this page</A>

<A NAME = "txt2html"></A><H3>txt2html - text file to HTML converter for WWW pages and documentation

</H3>
<P>This is a small C++ program (one file) that converts text files into
HTML files.  The text files can contain simple a few simple formatting
and markup commands that get converted into appropriate HTML syntax.
</P>
<P>I wrote this tool because I am more productive using a text editor
(emacs) to write vanilla text than trying to write HTML or use a
browser's WYSIWYG composer tool with an editor I don't like.  Anna
Reese wrote the table capabilities in txt2html.
</P>
<P>All the WWW pages on <A HREF = "main.html">my site</A> and the <A HREF = "https://www.lammps.org">LAMMPS
website</A> were converted to HTML via txt2html.
As you view any of those pages, you can see what the underlying text
file looks like, by changing the .html suffix of the URL you are
browsing to .txt (not the same as viewing the source of the HTML
file).  An example is given below.
</P>
<P>Curiously, looking at the .txt version of the page you are currently
on (download.html), or the doc and example files for the txt2html
itself, are not great examples of the simple syntax of .txt files that
the tool recognizes.  This is because they have to contain a lot of
native HTML to fool a browser into displaying HTML itself or
displaying the download form up above.
